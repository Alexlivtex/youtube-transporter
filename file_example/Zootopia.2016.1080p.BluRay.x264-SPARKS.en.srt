21
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:05,670
Fear, treachery, blood lust.

22
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:11,840
Thousands of years ago these were the forces that ruled our world

23
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:15,010
A world where prey were scared of predators.

24
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:18,570
And predators had an uncontrollable...

25
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:22,930
biological urge to maim, and maul, and...

26
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:28,070
Blood! Blood! Blood!

27
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:36,860
And.. Death!

28
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:46,050
Back then, the world was divided in two.

29
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:49,710
Vicious predator, or meek prey.

32
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:56,240
But over time, we evolved,

33
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,750
and moved beyond or primitive savage ways.

34
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:03,820
Now predator and prey live in harmony.

35
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:09,360
And every young mammal has multitudinous opportunities.

36
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,700
Yeah, I don't have to cower in a a herd anymore.

38
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:17,210
Instead, I can be an astronaut.

39
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:22,610
I don't have to be a lonely hunter anymore.

40
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:25,230
Today I can hunt for tax exemptions.

41
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:27,940
I'm gonna be an actuary.

42
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:34,900
And I can make the world a better place. I am going to be...

43
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,250
A police officer!

44
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:44,560
Bunny cop? That is the most stupidest thing I ever heard!

45
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,760
It may seem impossible to small minds.

46
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,910
I'm looking at you, Gideon Grey.

47
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:57,370
But, just 211 miles away, stands the great city of Zootopia.

48
00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:00,800
Where our ancestors first joined together in peace.

50
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:07,030
And declared that anyone can be anything!

51
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:10,840
Thank you and good night.

52
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,050
Judy, you ever wonder how

53
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:15,580
your mom and me got to be so darn happy?

54
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:16,190
Nope.

55
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:19,430
Well, we gave up on our dreams, and we settled. Right, Bon?

56
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:21,890
Oh, yes. That's right, Stu. We settled hard.

57
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:24,970
You see, that's the beauty of complacency, Jude.

58
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,290
If you don't try anything new, you'll never fail.

59
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:29,010
I like trying, actually.

60
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:30,200
What your father means, hon,

61
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:33,090
is that it's gonna be difficult, impossible even...

62
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:34,720
for you to become a police officer.

63
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,330
Right. There's never been a bunny cop.

64
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:37,400
- No. - Bunnies don't do that.

65
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,480
- Never. - Never.

66
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,530
Well... Then I guess I'll have to be the first one.

67
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:46,010
Because I am gonna make the world a better place!

68
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:48,170
Or, heck, you know.

69
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:50,260
You wanna talk about making the world a better place,

70
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:52,350
no better way to do it than becoming a carrot farmer.

71
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:56,610
Yes! Your dad, me, your 275 brothers and sisters.

72
00:03:56,610 --> 00:03:58,690
We're changing the world.

73
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:00,690
- One carrot at a time. - Amen to that.

74
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:03,110
Carrot farming is a noble profession.

75
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:04,960
Just pulling their seeds out

76
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,570
And one with the soil...

77
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,540
You get it, honey? I mean, it's great to have dreams.

78
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:12,540
Yeah, just as long as you don't believe in them too much.

79
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,410
Where the heck'd she go?

80
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:18,260
Give me your tickets right now,

81
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:21,150
or I'm gonna kick your meek little sheep butt.

82
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:22,770
Cut it out, Gideon!

83
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:25,770
Baah, baah! What are you gonna do, cry?

84
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:30,650
- You heard her. Cut it out. - Nice costume, loser.

85
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:32,460
What crazy world are you living in

86
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:35,050
where you think a bunny could be a cop?

87
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:37,050
Kindly return my friend's tickets.

88
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:39,470
Come and get them. But watch out.

89
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:40,550
Cause I'm a fox,

90
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:42,860
and like you said in your dumb little stage play,

91
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:45,080
us predators used to eat prey.

92
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:47,730
And that killer instinct's still in our DANA.

93
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:50,180
Uh, I'm pretty much sure it's pronounced DNA.

94
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:51,820
Don't tell me what I know, Travis.

95
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:54,100
You don't scare me, Gideon.

96
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:56,580
Scared now?

97
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:58,940
Look at her nose twitch, she is scared.

98
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:01,980
Cry, little baby bunny! Cry...

99
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:07,850
Oh, you don't know when to quit, do you?

100
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,830
I want you to remember this moment

101
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:18,670
the next time you think you will ever be...

102
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:22,620
anything more than just a stupid carrot-farming dumb bunny.

103
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:30,440
- That looks bad. - Are you okay, Judy?

104
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:34,510
Yeah, yeah, I'm okay. Here you go.

105
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:38,240
- Wow, you got our tickets! - You're awesome, Judy.

106
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:41,680
Yeah, that Gideon Grey doesn't know what he's talking about!

107
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,610
Well, he was right about one thing.

108
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:48,990
I don't know when to quit.

110
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,340
Listen up, cadets.

111
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:56,440
Zootopia has 12 unique ecosystems within its city limits.

113
00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:01,290
Tundratown, Sahara Square, Rainforest District, to name a few.

114
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:02,290
You're gonna have to

115
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:04,810
master all of them before you hit the streets.

116
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:07,710
Or guess what? You'll be dead!

117
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:10,710
Scorching sandstorm.

118
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,770
You're dead, bunny bumpkin.

119
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:17,260
One thousand foot fall.

120
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:20,760
You're dead, carrot face.

121
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:22,780
Frigid ice wall.

122
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:26,450
You're dead, farm girl.

123
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:30,070
Enormous criminal. You're dead.

124
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:32,040
Dead. Dead. Dead.

125
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:42,290
Filthy toilet. You're dead, fluff butt.

126
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:45,390
Just quit and go home, fuzzy bunny.

127
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:47,350
There's never been a bunny cop. - Never.

128
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,880
- Never. - Just a stupid carrot-farming dumb bunny.

129
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,900
As mayor of Zootopia,

130
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:23,180
I am proud to announce that my mammal inclusion initiative,

131
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:26,570
has produced its first police academy graduate.

132
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:32,350
Valedictorian of her class, ZPD's very first rabbit officer...

133
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:34,170
Judy Hopps.

134
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:40,010
Assistant Mayor Bellwether, her badge.

135
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:42,320
- Oh, yes, yes! - Thank you.

136
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:46,400
Judy, it is my great privilege

137
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:50,040
to officially assign you to the heart of Zootopia...

138
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:53,090
Precinct One. City Center.

139
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,070
Congratulations, Officer Hopps.

140
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:58,600
I won't let you down.

141
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:00,520
This has been my dream since I was a kid.

142
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:03,460
You know, it's a real proud day for us little guys.

143
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:05,040
Bellwether, make room, will you? Come on.

144
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,390
Okay, Officer Hopps. Let's see those teeth!

145
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:08,700
Officer Hopps, look here.

146
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:16,390
- We're real proud of you, Judy. - Yeah, and scared too.

147
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:18,930
- Yes. - Really, it's kind of a proud-scared combo.

148
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:22,950
I mean, Zootopia. So far away, such a big city.

149
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:25,560
Guys, I've been working for this my whole life.

150
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:29,260
We know. And we're just a little excited for you, but terrified.

151
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:32,180
The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.

152
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:34,550
And also bears. We have bears to fear, too.

153
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:37,090
- Say nothing on lions, and wolves. - Wolves?

154
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:38,140
- Weasels. - You played cribbage with a weasel once?

155
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:40,370
Yeah, he cheats like there's no tomorrow.

156
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:42,020
You know what? Pretty much all predators.

157
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:44,000
- And Zootopia is full of them. - Oh, Stu.

158
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,050
And foxes are the worst.

159
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:48,690
Yeah, actually, your father does have a point there.

160
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,710
It's in their biology. Remember what happened with Gideon Grey?

161
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:56,360
When I was nine. Gideon Grey was a jerk who happens to be a fox.

162
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,230
I know plenty of bunnies who are jerks.

163
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:01,420
Sure, yeah, we all do, absolutely. But just in case,

164
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:03,540
we made you a little care package to take with you.

165
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:05,880
- I put some snacks in there. - This is fox deterrent.

166
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,880
- Yeah, it's safe to have that. - This is fox repellant.

167
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,520
The deterrent and the repellant, that's all she needs.

168
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:11,800
- Check this out! - Oh, for goodness sake!

169
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,660
She has no need for a fox taser, Stu.

170
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:16,110
Oh, come on. When is there not a need for a fox taser?

171
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:19,030
Well, okay, look, I will take this... To make you stop talking.

172
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:20,730
Terrific! Everyone wins!

173
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,820
Arriving, Zootopia Express.

174
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:28,330
Okay, gotta go. Bye!

175
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,840
I love you, guys.

176
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:39,890
Love you, too.

177
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,100
Oh, cripes, here come the waterworks.

178
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,030
Oh, Stu. Pull it together.

179
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:46,400
Bye everybody!

180
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:51,020
Bye Judy, I love you! Bye!

181
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:56,440
Bye!

185
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:45,290
I'm Gazelle. Welcome to Zootopia.

186
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:48,600
And welcome to the Grand Pangolin Arms.

187
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,520
Luxury apartments with charm.

188
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,580
Complementary delousing once a month. Don't lose your key!

189
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:56,550
Thank you.

190
00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:00,370
- Oh, hi! I'm Judy, your new neighbour! - Yeah? Well, we're loud.

191
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:02,370
Don't expect us to apologize for it.

192
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:07,450
Greasy walls.

193
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:09,450
Rickety bed.

194
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,900
Crazy neighbors.

195
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:16,050
I love it!

196
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:38,600
Come on! He bared his teeth first!

197
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:41,780
Excuse me!

198
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:43,550
Down here!

199
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,240
- Hi. - O... M... Goodness!

200
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:49,010
They really did hire a bunny.

201
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:50,890
Ho-whop! I gotta tell you,

202
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:52,990
you're even cuter than I thought you'd be.

203
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:55,180
Ooh, ah, you probably didn't know,

204
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:58,790
but a bunny can call another bunny "Cute",

205
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:01,870
but when other animals do it, that's a little...

206
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:06,440
I am so sorry! Me, Benjamin Clawhauser.

207
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:07,440
The guy everyone thinks is

208
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,880
just a flabby donut-loving cop, stereotyping you.

209
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:12,220
No, it's okay.

210
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:14,930
You've actually got... there's a...

211
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:17,210
- A what? - In your neck. The fold.

212
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:21,140
- The... this... - Oh, there you went, you little dickens!

213
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:25,080
Hehehe, I should get to roll call, so which way do I...

214
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:28,250
- Oh, bull pen's over there to the left. - Great. Thank you!

215
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,680
That poor little bunny's gonna get eaten alive.

216
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:47,670
Officer Hopps. You ready to make the world a better place?

217
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:54,400
Attention!

218
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:00,890
All right. All right. Everybody sit.

219
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,570
I've got three items on the docket.

220
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:09,290
First, we need to acknowledge the elephant in the room.

222
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:13,330
Francine. Happy birthday.

223
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:17,630
Number two.

224
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:20,830
There are some new recruits with us I should introduce,

225
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:23,890
but I'm not going to because... I don't care.

226
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:29,620
Finally, we have 14 missing mammal cases.

227
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:34,250
All predators. From a giant polar bear to a teensy little otter.

228
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:38,020
And City Hall is right up my tail to find them.

229
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:42,560
This is priority number one. Assignments.

230
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:45,170
Officers Grizzoli, Fangmeyer, Delgato.

231
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:48,290
Your team take missing mammals from the Rainforest District.

232
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:52,080
Officers McHorn, Rhinowitz, Wolfard.

233
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:54,360
Your teams take Sahara Square.

234
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:58,310
Officers Higgins, Snarlov, Trunkaby. Tundratown.

235
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:03,820
And finally, our first bunny, Officer Hopps.

236
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:08,000
Parking duty. Dismissed.

237
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,870
Parking duty?

238
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:13,470
Chief? Chief Bogo?

239
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:18,440
Sir. You said there were fourteen missing mammal cases.

240
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,350
- So? - So I can handle one.

241
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:23,840
You probably forgot but, I was top of my class at the academy.

242
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:26,190
Didn't forget. Just don't care.

243
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:28,430
Sir, I'm not just some token bunny.

244
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:31,020
Well then, writing a hundred tickets a day should be easy.

245
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:38,330
100 tickets. I'm not gonna write 100 tickets.

246
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:42,240
I'm gonna write 200 tickets. Before noon.

248
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,050
Two hundred tickets before noon!

249
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,600
201.

250
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:52,880
Hey, watch where you're going, fox!

251
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:22,110
Where'd he go?

252
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:39,180
Listen. I know what you're doing

253
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:41,580
skulking around during daylight hours,

254
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:45,120
but I don't want any trouble in here. So hit the road!

255
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,440
I'm not looking for any trouble either, sir...

256
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:52,190
I simply wanna buy a Jumbo-Pop. For my little boy.

257
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:59,170
You want the red, or the blue, pal?

258
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:04,900
I'm such a...

259
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:06,530
Oh, come on, kid. Back up.

260
00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:07,610
- Listen, buddy. - What?

261
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:10,910
There aren't any fox ice cream joints in your part of town?

262
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:14,780
No, no. There are, there are. It's just, my boy,

263
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:17,240
this goofy little stinker, he loves all things elephant.

264
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,490
He wants to be one when he grows up.

265
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,350
Isn't that adorable?

266
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,620
Who the heck am I to crush his little dreams, huh? Right?

267
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:29,090
Look, you probably can't read, fox, but the sign says

268
00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:33,460
we reserve the right to refuse service to anyone!

269
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:34,740
So beat it.

270
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:36,600
You're holding up the line.

271
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:41,140
Hello. Excuse me.

272
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:41,990
Hey, you're gonna have to

273
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:44,640
wait your turn like everyone else, meter maid.

274
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,870
Actually, I'm an officer.

275
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:48,380
Just have a quick question.

276
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:50,510
Are your customers aware they're getting

277
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:53,050
snot and mucus with their cookies and cream?

278
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,870
What are you talking about?

279
00:19:55,870 --> 00:19:58,080
Well. I don't wanna cause you any trouble,

280
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,940
but I believe scooping ice cream with

281
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:03,210
an ungloved trunk is a class 3 health code violation.

282
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:06,830
Which is kind of a big deal.

283
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:07,720
Of course I could let you off

284
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,880
with a warning if you were to glove those trunks

285
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:13,270
and... I don't know... finish selling this...

286
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:17,150
nice dad and his son a... What was it?

287
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:19,520
A Jumbo-Pop. Please.

288
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,840
A Jumbo-Pop.

289
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:26,860
- $15. - Thank you so much. Thank you.

290
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:29,270
Oh no, are you kidding me...

291
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,230
I don't have my wallet!

292
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:35,050
I'd lose my head if it weren't attached to my neck.

293
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:38,060
That's the truth. Oh, boy. I'm sorry, pal.

294
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:39,980
Gotta be about the worst birthday ever.

295
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:43,790
Please don't be mad at me. Thanks anyway.

296
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:51,070
Keep the change.

297
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:54,030
Officer, I can't thank you enough.

298
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:56,620
So kind. Really. Can I pay you back?

299
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:58,240
Oh, no. My treat.

300
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,320
It's just, you know it burns me up

301
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:03,120
to see folks with such backward attitudes towards foxes.

302
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,000
I just want to say you're

303
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,770
a great dad and just a real articulate fella.

304
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:11,130
Well, that is high praise.

305
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:14,060
It's rare that I find someone so non-patronizing.

306
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:16,300
- Officer? - Hopps. Mr..?

307
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:18,140
Wilde. Nick Wilde.

308
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:22,350
And you, little guy. You wanna be an elephant when you grow up?

309
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:26,290
You be an elephant. Because this is Zootopia.

310
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:28,720
Anyone can be anything.

311
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:31,360
I tell him that all the time.

312
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,220
All right, here you go. Two paws.

313
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:37,710
Yeah. Oh, look at that smile, that's a happy birthday smile!

314
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:40,390
All right, give her a little bye-bye toot-toot.

315
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:44,770
- Bye, now! - Goodbye!

316
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:03,740
Hey, little toot-toot...

318
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,480
Pawpsicles.

319
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,540
Get your Pawpsicles.

321
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,050
- Lumber delivery. - What's with the color?

322
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:24,680
The color? Uh... it's redwood.

323
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:28,940
39, 40, there you go.

324
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:31,120
Way to work that diaper, big guy.

325
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,730
No kiss bye-bye for daddy?

326
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:39,350
You kiss me tomorrow, I'll bite your face off!

327
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:41,060
Ciao.

328
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:47,810
Well, I stood up for you, and you lied to me.

329
00:23:47,810 --> 00:23:49,130
You liar!

330
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:51,060
It's called a hustle, Sweetheart.

331
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:53,550
And I'm not the liar. He is.

332
00:23:57,950 --> 00:24:00,720
All right, Slick-Nick. You're under arrest.

333
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,140
Really? For what?

334
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:04,790
Gee, I don't know. How about selling food without a permit?

335
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:07,070
Transporting undeclared commerce across borough lines?

336
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:11,000
- False advertizing. - Permit. Receipt of declared commerce.

337
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,570
And I didn't falsely advertize anything. Take care.

338
00:24:13,570 --> 00:24:15,950
You told that mouse the Pawpsicle sticks were redwood!

339
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:18,620
That's right. Red wood. With a space in the middle.

340
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:19,950
Wood that is red.

341
00:24:20,930 --> 00:24:22,070
You can't touch me, Carrots.

342
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:24,030
I've been doing this since I was born.

343
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:26,300
You're gonna wanna refrain from calling me Carrots.

344
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:28,300
My bad. I just naturally assumed you came...

345
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,430
from some little carrot-choked Podunk. No?

346
00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:31,380
Uh, no.

347
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:34,150
Podunk is in Deerbrooke county and I grew up in Bunnyburrow.

348
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:37,380
Okay. Tell me if this story sounds familiar.

349
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:40,310
Naive little hick with good grades and big ideas

350
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:43,140
decides "Hey, look at me, I'm gonna move to Zootopia...

351
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:46,550
where predators and prey live in harmony and sing Kumbaya!"

352
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:49,820
Only to find, whoopsie, we don't all get along.

353
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:51,980
And that dream of becoming a big city cop,

354
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:53,930
double whoopsie, she's a meter maid.

355
00:24:53,930 --> 00:24:55,670
And whoopsie number three-sie,

356
00:24:55,670 --> 00:24:57,980
no one cares about her or her dreams.

357
00:24:57,980 --> 00:24:59,700
And soon enough those dreams die,

358
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:02,020
and our bunny sinks into emotional and literal squalor

359
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:03,550
living in a box under a bridge.

360
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:06,180
Till finally she has no choice but to go back home

361
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:07,200
with that cute fuzzy wuzzy

362
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,480
little tail between her legs to become...

363
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:11,450
You're from Bunnyburrow, is that what you said?

364
00:25:11,450 --> 00:25:13,230
So how about a carrot farmer?

365
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:14,900
That sound about right?

366
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,660
Be careful now, or it won't just be your dreams getting crushed.

367
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:25,980
No one tells me what I can or can't be.

368
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:29,350
Especially not some jerk who never had the guts to

369
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:32,760
try to be anything more than a Pawpsicle hustler.

370
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:33,720
All right, look.

371
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:36,000
Everyone comes to Zootopia

372
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,390
thinking they can be anything they want.

373
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:41,720
Well, you can't. You can only be what you are.

374
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:44,720
Sly fox. Dumb bunny.

375
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:47,180
I'm not a dumb bunny.

376
00:25:47,430 --> 00:25:50,370
Right. And that's not wet cement.

377
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:53,460
You'll never be a real cop.

378
00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:56,180
You're a cute meter maid, though.

379
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:59,500
Maybe a supervisor one day. Hang in there.

382
00:26:52,690 --> 00:26:56,810
- Oh, hey, it's my parents! - Oh, there she is! Hi, Sweetheart!

383
00:26:56,810 --> 00:26:58,270
Hey there, Jude the Dude.

384
00:26:58,270 --> 00:27:00,240
How was your first day on the force?

385
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:03,840
- It was real great! - Yeah? Everything you ever hoped?

386
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:06,530
Absolutely. And more.

387
00:27:06,530 --> 00:27:09,360
Everyone's so nice, and I feel like...

388
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,260
I'm really making a difference.

389
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:12,040
Wait a second. Holy cranks, Bonnie.

390
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:14,410
- Look at that! - Oh, my sweet heaven!

391
00:27:14,410 --> 00:27:16,060
Judy, are you a meter maid?

392
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:18,950
Oh, this.. No! Oh, no. This is just a temporary thing..

393
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,990
- It's the safest job on the force! - She's not a real cop!

394
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:23,970
- Our prayers have been answered! - Glorious day!

395
00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:26,280
Ho-ho, meter maid, meter maid, meter maid!

396
00:27:26,290 --> 00:27:28,470
- Dad! Dad! - Meter maid!

397
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:30,500
You know what, it's been a really long day, I should...

398
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:33,190
- You get some rest. - Those meters aren't gonna maid themselves.

399
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:36,640
- Bye-bye. - Bye-bye.

400
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:43,350
Hey, bunny! Turn down that depressing music!

401
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:47,640
Leave the meter maid alone, didn't you hear her conversation?

402
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,840
- She feels like a failure! - Oh, shut up!

403
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,390
- You shut up! - You shut up!

404
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:54,930
- You shut up! - Tomorrow is another day.

405
00:27:55,130 --> 00:27:57,330
Yeah, but it might be worse!

406
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:01,780
I was 30 seconds over!

407
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:05,390
Yeah, you're a real hero, lady.

408
00:28:06,410 --> 00:28:09,570
My mommy says she wishes you were dead.

409
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:13,510
Uncool rabbit, my tax dollars pay your salary.

410
00:28:14,410 --> 00:28:17,500
I am a real cop. I am a real cop.

411
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:20,090
I am a real cop. I am a real cop.

412
00:28:20,090 --> 00:28:21,440
Hey, you! Bunny!

413
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,680
Sir, if you have a grievance

414
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,570
you may contest recitation in traffic court.

415
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:27,570
What are you talking about?! My shop!

416
00:28:27,570 --> 00:28:30,960
It was just robbed! Look, he's getting away!

417
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,980
Well, are you a cop or not?

418
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:35,890
Yes! Yes! Don't worry, sir, I got this!

419
00:28:40,090 --> 00:28:41,060
Stop!

420
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:42,580
Stop in the name of the law!

421
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:44,970
Catch me if ya' can, cottontail!

422
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,580
Coming through!

423
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:55,690
This is officer McHorn. We got a 10-31.

424
00:28:55,690 --> 00:28:59,260
I got dibs! Officer Hopps, I am in pursuit!

426
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:17,160
You! Freeze!

427
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:20,230
Hey, meter maid! Wait for the real cops!

428
00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:22,410
Stop!

429
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:53,400
Sorry! Coming through. Excuse me. Excuse me. Pardon.

430
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:00,160
Bon voyage, flatfoot!

431
00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:20,510
- Stop right there! - Have a donut, coppa!

434
00:30:21,790 --> 00:30:25,420
Oh my god, did you see those leopard print jeggings?

435
00:30:31,650 --> 00:30:34,500
- I love your hair. - Thank you.

436
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:37,090
Come to papa!

437
00:30:39,610 --> 00:30:42,180
Okay. You're gonna have to be patient and wait in line

438
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:44,870
just like everyone else, Mrs. Otterton. Okay?

439
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:55,390
- I popped the weasel! - Hopps!

441
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:01,160
Abandoning your post. Inciting a scurry.

442
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:03,310
Reckless endangerment of rodents...

443
00:31:03,310 --> 00:31:05,350
But, to be fair,

444
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:06,510
you did stop a master criminal

445
00:31:06,510 --> 00:31:08,870
from stealing two dozen moldy onions.

446
00:31:09,530 --> 00:31:12,360
Hate to disagree with you, sir, but those aren't onions.

447
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:14,870
Those are a crocus variety called midnicampum holicithias.

448
00:31:14,870 --> 00:31:16,540
They're a class C botanical, sir.

449
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:17,470
Well, I grew up in a family

450
00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:19,000
where plant husbandry was kind of a thing...

451
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:23,570
- Shut your tiny mouth now! - Sir, I got the bad guy.

452
00:31:23,570 --> 00:31:24,610
That's my job.

453
00:31:24,610 --> 00:31:28,230
Your job is putting tickets on parked cars!

454
00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:31,200
Chief, Mrs. Otterton's here to see you again.

455
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,090
- Not now. - Okay, I just need to know if you want to...

456
00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:35,520
- take it this time she seems really upset... - Not now!

457
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:37,840
Sir. I don't wanna be a meter maid,

458
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:40,500
I wanna be a real cop.

459
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:43,430
Do you think the mayor asked what I wanted...

460
00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:45,670
- when he assigned you to me? - But, sir...

461
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:47,980
Life isn't some cartoon musical

462
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:51,020
where you sing a little song, and your insipid dreams...

463
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:55,860
magically come true! So let it go.

464
00:31:56,840 --> 00:32:00,160
Chief Bogo, please! Five minutes of your time, please.

465
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:03,530
I'm sorry sir. I tried to stop her, she's super slippery.

466
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,000
I gotta go sit down.

467
00:32:05,010 --> 00:32:08,660
Ma'am, as I've told you, we're doing everything we can.

468
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:11,340
My husband has been missing for ten days.

469
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:14,000
- His name is Emmitt Otterton. - Yes. I know.

470
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,840
He's a florist. We have 2 beautiful children.

471
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:19,730
He would never just disappear.

472
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:22,710
Ma'am, our detectives are very busy.

473
00:32:22,930 --> 00:32:26,530
Please. There's gotta be somebody to find my Emmitt.

474
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:29,070
- Mrs. Otterton. - I will find him.

475
00:32:30,730 --> 00:32:35,570
Thank you! Bless you, bless you, little bunny!

476
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:40,690
Take this. Find my Emmitt.

477
00:32:41,030 --> 00:32:43,960
Bring him home to me and my babies. Please.

478
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:46,510
Mrs. Otterton. Please wait out here.

479
00:32:46,510 --> 00:32:48,620
Of course. Oh, thank you both so much!

480
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:49,720
One second.

481
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:54,210
- You're fired. - What? Why?

482
00:32:54,210 --> 00:32:57,670
Insubordination! Now. I'm going to open this door,

483
00:32:57,670 --> 00:32:59,110
and you're going to tell that Otter

484
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:02,620
you're a former meter maid with delusion of grandeur,

485
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:04,840
who will not be taking the case.

486
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:07,990
I just heard Officer Hopps is taking the case!

487
00:33:07,990 --> 00:33:09,190
Assistant Mayor Bellwether!

488
00:33:09,190 --> 00:33:12,730
The Mammal Inclusion Initiative is really starting to pay off.

489
00:33:12,850 --> 00:33:15,220
Mayor Lionheart is just gonna be so jazzed!

490
00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:16,960
No, let's not tell the mayor just yet.

491
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:19,750
And I sent it, and it is done, so I did do that.

492
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:22,000
All right, well, I'd say the case is in good hands.

493
00:33:22,010 --> 00:33:24,730
Us little guys really need to stick together, right?

494
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:27,330
- Like glue. - Good one.

495
00:33:27,330 --> 00:33:29,510
Just call me if you ever need anything. Okay?

496
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:30,970
You've always got a friend at City Hall,

497
00:33:30,970 --> 00:33:33,080
Judy. All right! Bye-bye!

498
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:34,230
Thank you, ma'am!

499
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:42,180
I will give you 48 hours.

500
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:42,900
Yes!

501
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:45,560
- That's two days to find Emmitt Otterton. - Okay.

502
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:50,540
But...you strike out, you resign.

503
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:56,310
Okay. Deal.

504
00:33:56,310 --> 00:34:00,740
Splendid. Clawhauser will give you the complete case file.

505
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:03,760
Here you go. One missing otter.

508
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:07,090
- That's it? - Yikes!

509
00:34:07,090 --> 00:34:10,480
That is the smallest case file I've ever seen. Leads, none.

510
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,540
Witnesses, none.

511
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:13,450
And you're not in the computer system yet, so...

512
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:15,200
Resources, none!

513
00:34:15,610 --> 00:34:17,240
Hoo, I hope you didn't stake your career

514
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:18,870
on cracking this one.

515
00:34:19,070 --> 00:34:21,990
Okay. Last known sighting.

517
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:28,940
Can I just borrow? Thank you.

518
00:34:32,190 --> 00:34:35,280
- Pawpsicle? - The murder weapon!

519
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:39,320
- "Get your Pawpsicle"... - Yeah! Cause that...

520
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:41,080
What does that mean?

521
00:34:41,090 --> 00:34:45,430
It means I have a lead.

522
00:34:50,470 --> 00:34:55,410
- Hi! Hello! It's me again! - Hey! It's Officer Toot-Toot.

523
00:34:56,150 --> 00:34:57,630
No. Actually it's Officer Hopps,

524
00:34:57,630 --> 00:35:00,500
and I'm here to ask you some questions about a case.

525
00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:01,510
What happened, meter maid?

526
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:03,180
Did someone steal a traffic cone?

527
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:04,320
It wasn't me.

528
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:09,580
Hey, Carrots, you're gonna wake the baby.

529
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:10,360
I gotta get to work.

530
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,720
This is important, sir.

531
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:15,520
I think your ten dollars worth of Pawpsicles can wait.

532
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:18,510
I make 200 bucks a day, fluff.

533
00:35:18,510 --> 00:35:21,940
365 days a year, since I was 12.

534
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:23,590
And time is money. Hop along.

535
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:25,190
Please just look at the picture.

536
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:27,660
You sold Mr. Otterton that Pawpsicle, right?

537
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:29,800
- Do you know him? - I know everybody.

538
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,570
And I also know that somewhere

539
00:35:31,570 --> 00:35:33,180
there's a toy store missing its stuffed animal,

540
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:35,330
so why don't you get back to your box?

541
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:38,620
Fine. Then we'll have to do this the hard way.

542
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,290
Did you just boot my stroller?

543
00:35:41,290 --> 00:35:44,100
Nicholas Wilde, you are under arrest.

544
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:46,260
For what? Hurting your feelings?

545
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:47,800
Felony tax evasion.

546
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:52,150
Yeah.. 200 dollars a day, 365 days a year,

547
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:52,920
since you were 12...

548
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,430
that's two decades, so times twenty,

549
00:35:54,430 --> 00:35:58,340
which is 1,460,000, I think.

550
00:35:58,350 --> 00:36:00,360
I mean, I am just a dumb bunny,

551
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:01,900
but we are good at multiplying.

552
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:03,510
Anyway, according to your tax forms,

553
00:36:03,510 --> 00:36:06,830
you reported, let me see here, zero!

554
00:36:06,830 --> 00:36:08,230
Unfortunately,

555
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:11,160
lying on a federal form is a punishable offense.

556
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:15,500
- 5 years jail time. - Well, it's my word against yours.

557
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:17,930
200 bucks a day, fluff,

558
00:36:17,930 --> 00:36:21,050
365 days a year, since I was twelve.

559
00:36:21,050 --> 00:36:22,890
Actually it's your word against yours.

560
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:24,580
And if you want this pen you're going to help me

561
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:26,820
find this poor missing otter, or the only place

562
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:30,030
you'll be selling Pawpsicles is the prison cafeteria.

563
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:33,170
It's called a hustle, sweet heart.

564
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:35,530
She hustled you.

565
00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:41,840
She hustled you good!

566
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:43,810
You're a cop now, Nick.

567
00:36:43,810 --> 00:36:45,630
You're gonna need one of these.

568
00:36:46,890 --> 00:36:49,070
Have fun working with the fuzz!

569
00:36:51,070 --> 00:36:52,110
Start talking.

570
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:56,860
I don't know where he is, I only saw where he went.

571
00:36:56,860 --> 00:36:57,910
Great, let's go!

572
00:36:59,470 --> 00:37:02,730
It's not exactly a place for a cute little bunny.

573
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:07,080
- Don't call me cute, get in the car. - Okay. You're the boss.

574
00:37:26,270 --> 00:37:28,200
Hi. Hello?

575
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:31,550
I'm... Hello?

576
00:37:31,830 --> 00:37:34,020
Hello? Hello?

577
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:38,320
Hello! My name is...

578
00:37:38,330 --> 00:37:41,490
You know, I'm gonna hit the pause button right there.

579
00:37:41,490 --> 00:37:44,290
Cause we're all good on bunny scout cookies.

580
00:37:44,290 --> 00:37:46,220
Uh, no.

581
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:48,740
I'm Officer Hopps, ZPD.

582
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:50,600
I'm looking for a missing mammal...

583
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,790
Emmitt Otterton. Right here.

584
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,910
He may have frequented this establishment?

585
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:01,780
Yeah, old Emmitt!

586
00:38:02,730 --> 00:38:05,000
Haven't seen him in a couple of weeks.

587
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:08,480
But hey, you should talk to his yoga instructor.

588
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,080
I'd be happy to take you back.

589
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,000
Oh, thank you so much,

590
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,180
I'd appericiate that more than you can imagine, it'd be such...

591
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:14,950
Oh! You are naked..

592
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:18,010
Oh, for sure. We're a naturalist club!

593
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:21,470
Yeah. In Zootopia anyone can be anything.

594
00:38:21,470 --> 00:38:23,950
These guys, they be naked.

595
00:38:23,950 --> 00:38:27,620
Nangi's just on the other side of the Pleasure Pool.

596
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:37,680
Oh boy. Does this make you uncomfortable?

597
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:40,980
Because if so, there's no shame in calling it quits.

598
00:38:41,290 --> 00:38:43,170
Yes, there is.

599
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,120
Boy, that's the spirit.

600
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:49,850
Yeah, some mammals say the naturalist life is weird.

601
00:38:49,850 --> 00:38:52,120
But you know what I say is weird?

602
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:55,990
Clothes on animals! Here we go!

603
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:58,570
As you can see, Nangi is an elephant,

604
00:38:58,570 --> 00:39:01,300
so she'll totally remember everything.

605
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:02,630
Hey, Nangi.

606
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:06,250
These dudes have some questions about Emmitt the otter.

607
00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:07,150
Who?

608
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:08,660
Emmitt Otterton.

609
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:11,760
Been coming to your yoga class for like six years.

610
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,420
I have no memory of this beaver.

611
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:15,190
He's an otter, actually.

612
00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:17,560
He was here a couple of Wednesdays ago. Remember?

613
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:18,070
No.

614
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:21,610
Yeah, he was wearing a green cable knit sweater vest,

615
00:39:21,610 --> 00:39:24,350
and a new pair of Quarterway slacks.

616
00:39:24,350 --> 00:39:27,550
Oh, and a Paisley tie, sweet Windsor knot.

617
00:39:27,550 --> 00:39:30,480
- Real tight. Remember that, Nangi? - No.

618
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,070
Yeah, and we both walked him out,

619
00:39:32,070 --> 00:39:35,750
and he got into this big old white car with a silver trim.

620
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:37,070
Needed a tune up.

621
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:40,130
The third cylinder wasn't firing. Remember that, Nangi?

622
00:39:40,130 --> 00:39:41,060
No.

623
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:45,190
You didn't happen to catch the licence plate number?

624
00:39:45,230 --> 00:39:47,100
- Did you? - Oh, for sure.

625
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:52,030
It was 2-9-T-H-D-0-3.

626
00:39:52,030 --> 00:39:54,600
0-3. Wow, this is a lot of great info. Thank you.

627
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:58,180
Told you Nangi has a mind like a steel trap.

628
00:39:58,210 --> 00:40:01,140
I wish I had a memory like an elephant.

630
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:06,970
Well, I had a ball. You are welcome for the clue.

631
00:40:06,970 --> 00:40:08,910
And seeing as any moron can run a plate,

632
00:40:08,910 --> 00:40:12,260
I will take that pen and bid you adieu.

633
00:40:12,350 --> 00:40:14,660
The plate. I can't run a plate.

634
00:40:14,990 --> 00:40:16,650
I'm not in the system yet.

635
00:40:16,770 --> 00:40:20,420
- Give me the pen, please. - What was it you said?

636
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:22,640
Any moron can run a plate?

637
00:40:22,650 --> 00:40:25,470
Gosh, if only there were a moron around

638
00:40:25,470 --> 00:40:27,050
who were up to the task.

639
00:40:27,050 --> 00:40:28,750
Rabbit, I did what you asked.

640
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,670
You can't keep me on the hook forever.

641
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:31,790
Not forever.

642
00:40:31,790 --> 00:40:35,010
Well, I only have 36 hours left to solve this case.

643
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:37,460
So can you run the plate or not?

644
00:40:39,090 --> 00:40:43,600
Actually, I just remembered, I have a pal at the DMV.

646
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:45,730
Flash is the fastest guy in there.

647
00:40:45,730 --> 00:40:47,320
You need something done, he's on it.

648
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:47,840
I hope so.

649
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:51,200
We are really fighting the clock and every minute counts.

650
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:54,950
Wait. They're all sloths?

651
00:41:23,270 --> 00:41:25,180
You said this was going to be quick!

652
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:26,710
What, are you saying just because he's a sloth

653
00:41:26,710 --> 00:41:28,470
he can't be fast?

654
00:41:28,470 --> 00:41:30,950
I thought in Zootopia anyone could be anything.

655
00:41:30,950 --> 00:41:32,960
Flash, Flash, Hundred Yard Dash!

656
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,400
Buddy, it's nice to see you.

657
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:41,770
Nice to... see you... too.

658
00:41:41,770 --> 00:41:44,080
Hey, Flash, I'd love you to meet my friend.

659
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:46,260
Ah... Darlin, I've forgotten your name.

660
00:41:47,010 --> 00:41:49,220
Officer Judy Hopps, ZPD. How are you?

661
00:41:49,790 --> 00:41:50,990
I am...

662
00:41:51,610 --> 00:41:54,320
doing... just..

663
00:41:55,210 --> 00:42:01,170
- Fine? - As well..as..I can..be...

664
00:42:01,210 --> 00:42:02,630
- What... - Hang in there.

665
00:42:02,630 --> 00:42:05,970
- can I...do... - Well, I was hoping you could run a plate...

666
00:42:05,970 --> 00:42:08,380
- for you... - Well, I was hoping you could...

667
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:09,360
...today?

668
00:42:12,190 --> 00:42:14,780
Well, I was hoping you could run a plate for us.

669
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:16,990
We are in a really big hurry.

670
00:42:18,130 --> 00:42:23,310
- Sure... What's the...plate... - 2-9-T...

671
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:27,860
- number? - 2-9-T-H-D-0-3.

672
00:42:36,490 --> 00:42:43,090
-29  -THD03
- 2...9... - T-H-D-0-3.

673
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:47,600
-T  -HD03
- T... - H-D-0-3.

674
00:42:48,620 --> 00:42:51,750
-H  -D03
- H... - D-0-3.

675
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:57,220
-D  -03
- D... - 0-3.

676
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:00,570
-0  -3
- 0... - 3!

677
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:05,230
- Hey, Flash. Wanna hear a joke? - No!

678
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:07,120
Sure.

679
00:43:08,570 --> 00:43:11,730
What do you call a three-humped camel?

680
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:19,010
I don't know. What do you call...

681
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:24,580
- Three-humped camel. - A three-humped...camel?

682
00:43:25,270 --> 00:43:26,390
Pregnant.

683
00:43:41,430 --> 00:43:43,460
Ha ha. Yes, very funny, very funny!

684
00:43:43,460 --> 00:43:45,530
Can we please just focus on the task?

685
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:46,180
Wait, wait!

686
00:43:46,190 --> 00:43:49,040
- Priscilla! - Oh, no!

687
00:43:49,780 --> 00:43:55,520
- Yes...Flash? - What...do..

688
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:56,580
- No... - you call...

689
00:43:56,590 --> 00:43:58,080
A three-humped camel?

690
00:43:58,080 --> 00:44:00,340
Pregnant! Okay! Great! We got it!

691
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:01,870
- Please just... - three...humped...

693
00:44:14,750 --> 00:44:17,480
- Here...you... - Yes! Yeah, yeah! Hurry, thank you!

694
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:19,050
- 2-9-T-H-D-0-3. - ...go.

695
00:44:19,050 --> 00:44:22,130
It's registered to Tundratown Limo Service.

696
00:44:22,130 --> 00:44:24,540
A limo took Otterton! And the limo's in Tundratown!

697
00:44:24,540 --> 00:44:25,530
It's in Tundratown!

698
00:44:25,540 --> 00:44:27,420
Way to hustle, bud. I love you. I owe you.

699
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:29,340
Hurry! We gotta beat the rush hour and...

700
00:44:29,340 --> 00:44:30,840
It's night?!

701
00:44:32,620 --> 00:44:34,480
Closed. Great.

703
00:44:34,650 --> 00:44:38,350
And I will betcha you don't have a warrant to get in, hmm?

704
00:44:38,490 --> 00:44:42,280
- Darn it. It's a bummer. - You wasted the day on purpose.

705
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:44,330
Ma'am, I have a fake badge.

706
00:44:44,330 --> 00:44:46,640
I would never impede your pretend investigation.

707
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:48,650
It's not a pretend investigation!

708
00:44:48,650 --> 00:44:52,460
Look, see? See him? This otter is missing.

709
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:55,170
Well, then they should have gotten a real cop to find him.

710
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:57,460
What is your problem? Does seeing me fail

711
00:44:57,460 --> 00:45:00,640
somehow make you feel better about your own sad, miserable life?

712
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:02,450
It does, 100 %.

713
00:45:02,850 --> 00:45:06,180
Now, since you're sans warrant.

714
00:45:06,180 --> 00:45:08,360
I guess we're done?

715
00:45:10,750 --> 00:45:13,820
Fine. We are done. Here's your pen.

716
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:21,170
First off, you throw like a bunny.

717
00:45:21,170 --> 00:45:23,320
Second, you're a very sore loser.

718
00:45:23,330 --> 00:45:26,290
See you later, Officer Fluff. So sad this is over.

719
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:27,910
I wish I could have helped more.

720
00:45:27,910 --> 00:45:29,270
The thing is,

721
00:45:29,430 --> 00:45:31,430
you don't need a warrant if you have probable cause,

722
00:45:31,430 --> 00:45:32,770
and I'm pretty sure I saw a...

723
00:45:32,770 --> 00:45:35,610
shifty lowlife climbing the fence.

724
00:45:35,610 --> 00:45:38,010
So you're helping plenty! Come on!

725
00:45:40,070 --> 00:45:43,270
2-9-T-H-D-0-3! This is it!

726
00:45:51,930 --> 00:45:53,260
Polar bear fur.

727
00:45:56,290 --> 00:45:57,890
- Oh my God! - What? What?

728
00:45:57,890 --> 00:45:59,820
The Velvety Pipes of Jerry Vole!

729
00:46:01,540 --> 00:46:04,520
But on CD. Who still uses CDs?

730
00:46:10,210 --> 00:46:14,430
Carrots, if your otter was here, he had a very bad day.

731
00:46:16,170 --> 00:46:18,550
Those are claw marks.

732
00:46:19,390 --> 00:46:21,290
You ever seen anything like this?

733
00:46:21,290 --> 00:46:23,590
- No. - Oh, wait. Look!

734
00:46:26,050 --> 00:46:30,160
This is him. Emmitt Otterton. He was definitely here.

735
00:46:31,100 --> 00:46:32,820
What do you think happened?

736
00:46:36,150 --> 00:46:39,300
Oh no, wait a minute. Polar bear fur...

737
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:42,170
Rat-pack music. Fancy cup.

738
00:46:42,170 --> 00:46:43,600
I know whose car this is, we gotta go!

739
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:44,770
What? Whose car is it?

740
00:46:44,770 --> 00:46:46,490
The most feared crime boss in Tundratown.

741
00:46:46,490 --> 00:46:48,080
They call him Mr. Big,

742
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:50,480
and he does not like me. So we gotta go!

743
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:52,300
I'm not leaving, this is a crime scene.

744
00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:53,740
Well, it's gonna be an even bigger crime scene...

745
00:46:53,740 --> 00:46:54,730
if Mr. Big finds me here,

746
00:46:54,730 --> 00:46:56,380
so we're leaving right now.

747
00:46:58,280 --> 00:47:01,870
Raymond! And is that Kevin? Long time, no see.

748
00:47:01,870 --> 00:47:06,350
And speaking of no see, how about you forget you saw me?

749
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:07,890
For old times sake?

750
00:47:08,140 --> 00:47:09,140
That's a no.

751
00:47:23,130 --> 00:47:25,560
What did you do that made Mr. Big so mad at you?

752
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:29,290
I, uh... I may have sold him a very expensive wall rug

753
00:47:29,290 --> 00:47:35,300
that was made from the fur of a skunk's butt.

754
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:38,990
Oh, sweet cheese 'n crackers.

755
00:47:53,390 --> 00:47:55,480
- Is that Mr. Big? - No.

756
00:47:55,990 --> 00:47:58,880
- What about him? Is that him? - No.

757
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:03,080
- That's gotta be him. - Stop talking.

758
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:04,670
Stop talking. Stop talking!

759
00:48:13,700 --> 00:48:17,030
Mr. Big, sir, this is a simple misunder...

760
00:48:17,570 --> 00:48:18,400
Yeah.

761
00:48:20,970 --> 00:48:23,000
This is a simple misunderstanding.

762
00:48:24,070 --> 00:48:25,330
You come here unannounced

763
00:48:25,330 --> 00:48:27,250
on the day my daughter is to be married.

764
00:48:27,250 --> 00:48:30,060
Well, actually, we were brought here against our will, so...

765
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:33,990
Point is, I did not know that it was your car,

766
00:48:33,990 --> 00:48:36,430
and I certainly did not know about your daughter's wedding!

767
00:48:37,890 --> 00:48:39,650
I trusted you, Nicky.

768
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:41,850
I welcomed you into my home.

769
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:43,510
We broke bread together.

770
00:48:43,860 --> 00:48:46,150
Grandmama made you a cannoli.

771
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:48,830
And how did you repay my generosity?

772
00:48:49,090 --> 00:48:52,960
With a rug made from the butt of a skunk.

773
00:48:53,150 --> 00:48:54,800
A skunk-butt rug.

774
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:56,770
You disrespected me.

775
00:48:56,980 --> 00:48:59,010
You disrespected my grandmama,

776
00:48:59,010 --> 00:49:01,920
who I buried in that skunk-butt rug.

777
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:05,610
I told you never to show your face here again,

778
00:49:05,620 --> 00:49:06,920
but here you are.

779
00:49:07,210 --> 00:49:08,820
Snooping around with this...

780
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:12,580
What are you? A performer? What's with the costume?

781
00:49:12,580 --> 00:49:14,640
- Sir, I am a co... - Mime!

782
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:17,780
She's a mime. This mime can not speak.

783
00:49:17,780 --> 00:49:20,240
- You can't speak if you're a mime. - No, I am a cop.

784
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:22,080
And I'm on the Emmitt Otterton case.

785
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:24,700
And my evidence puts him in your car!

786
00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:26,460
So intimidate me all you want,

787
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:28,550
I'm going to find out what you did to that otter

788
00:49:28,550 --> 00:49:31,110
if it's the last thing I do.

789
00:49:33,420 --> 00:49:35,800
Then I have only one request.

790
00:49:36,350 --> 00:49:38,880
Say hello to Grandmama.

791
00:49:39,010 --> 00:49:39,810
Ice 'em!

792
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:43,070
No, no, no. I didn't see nothing! I'm not saying nothing!

793
00:49:43,070 --> 00:49:44,030
And you never will.

794
00:49:44,030 --> 00:49:46,160
Please! No, no, no, no!

795
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:48,500
If you're mad at me about the rug, I've got more rugs!

796
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:52,640
Daddy! It's time for our dance!

797
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:57,780
What did we say? No icing anyone at my wedding!

798
00:49:57,790 --> 00:50:00,710
I have to, baby, daddy has to.

799
00:50:00,710 --> 00:50:02,420
- Ice 'em. - No, no, no!

800
00:50:02,420 --> 00:50:04,020
Wait, wait!

801
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:06,970
She's the bunny that saved my life yesterday!

802
00:50:06,970 --> 00:50:08,860
From that giant donut!

803
00:50:08,860 --> 00:50:11,700
- This bunny? - Yeah. Hi!

804
00:50:11,700 --> 00:50:15,850
- Hi. I love your dress. - Thank you.

805
00:50:16,570 --> 00:50:17,660
Put them down.

806
00:50:20,860 --> 00:50:22,730
You've done me a great service.

807
00:50:22,730 --> 00:50:24,840
I will help you find the otter.

808
00:50:25,070 --> 00:50:29,250
I will take your kindness, and pay it forward.

809
00:50:58,130 --> 00:51:02,470
Otterton is my florist. He's like a part of the family.

810
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:05,890
He had something important he wanted to discuss.

811
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:08,900
That's why I sent that car to pick him up.

812
00:51:09,620 --> 00:51:11,260
But he never arrived.

813
00:51:11,790 --> 00:51:13,360
Because he was attacked.

814
00:51:13,450 --> 00:51:16,240
No, he attacked.

815
00:51:16,350 --> 00:51:17,600
Otterton?

816
00:51:17,710 --> 00:51:18,720
Otterton.

817
00:51:19,010 --> 00:51:22,370
He went crazy. Ripped up the car.

818
00:51:22,370 --> 00:51:25,010
Scared my driver half to death.

819
00:51:25,110 --> 00:51:27,320
And disappeared into the night.

820
00:51:27,860 --> 00:51:30,150
But he's a sweet little otter.

821
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:35,040
My child, we may be evolved,

822
00:51:35,170 --> 00:51:38,720
but deep down we are still animals.

823
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:44,100
You wanna find Otterton, talk to the driver of the car.

824
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:48,300
His name is Manchas. Lives in the Rainforest District.

825
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:50,650
Only he can tell you more.

826
00:51:54,870 --> 00:51:56,370
Mr. Manchas?

827
00:51:56,650 --> 00:51:58,720
Judy Hopps, ZPD.

828
00:51:58,760 --> 00:52:02,180
We just wanna know what happened to Emmitt Otterton.

829
00:52:06,830 --> 00:52:12,420
You should be asking what happened to me.

830
00:52:13,220 --> 00:52:17,820
- A teensy otter did that? - What happened?

831
00:52:17,820 --> 00:52:20,050
He was an animal.

832
00:52:21,340 --> 00:52:24,560
Down on all fours.

833
00:52:27,770 --> 00:52:29,580
He was a savage!

834
00:52:39,940 --> 00:52:41,310
There was no warning.

835
00:52:41,310 --> 00:52:44,330
He just kept yelling about the Night Howlers.

836
00:52:44,330 --> 00:52:47,450
Over and over, the Night Howlers!

837
00:52:47,450 --> 00:52:51,060
So you know about the Night Howlers too?

838
00:52:51,170 --> 00:52:54,820
Good, good. Because the Night Howlers are exactly

839
00:52:54,820 --> 00:52:58,060
what we are here to talk about. Right?

840
00:52:58,060 --> 00:53:02,860
Yep, so you just open the door and tell us what you know,

841
00:53:02,970 --> 00:53:04,890
and we will tell you what we know.

842
00:53:05,110 --> 00:53:05,960
Okay?

843
00:53:07,450 --> 00:53:08,370
Okay.

844
00:53:10,390 --> 00:53:11,740
Clever fox.

845
00:53:16,020 --> 00:53:18,280
Mr. Manchas?

846
00:53:23,250 --> 00:53:25,860
Are you okay?

847
00:53:28,460 --> 00:53:30,070
Run. Run!

848
00:53:35,060 --> 00:53:37,490
- What is wrong with him?! - I don't know!

849
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:43,580
Jump!

850
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:47,250
Come on!

851
00:53:52,300 --> 00:53:53,210
Head down!

852
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:56,940
Officer Hopps to dispatch!

853
00:53:56,940 --> 00:53:58,010
Are you familiar with Gazelle?

854
00:53:58,010 --> 00:54:00,190
Greatest singer of our lifetime. Angel with horns.

855
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:02,110
Okay, hold on. Keep watching.

856
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:03,450
Who's that beside her? Who is it?

857
00:54:03,450 --> 00:54:07,750
Wow,You are one hot dancer, Benjamin Clawhauser.

858
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:12,260
It's me! Did you think it was real? It looks so real!

859
00:54:12,260 --> 00:54:13,980
It's not, it's just a new app.

860
00:54:13,980 --> 00:54:16,390
- Hold on a second. - Clawhauser!

861
00:54:16,390 --> 00:54:17,390
Clawhauser, listen to me.

862
00:54:17,390 --> 00:54:20,270
We have a 10-91! Jaguar gone savage!

863
00:54:20,270 --> 00:54:23,280
- Vine and Tujunga!  - It's Tuhunga!

864
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:24,490
Okay, we're sending backup!

865
00:54:24,490 --> 00:54:26,980
Hopps, Hopps!

866
00:54:28,450 --> 00:54:31,140
Look, over there! Head for the sky-trams!

867
00:54:40,370 --> 00:54:43,360
Get in. Carrots? Carrots!

868
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:44,340
Go!

869
00:54:47,790 --> 00:54:51,350
Buddy, one predator to another.

870
00:54:55,300 --> 00:54:56,950
Now I can tell you're a little tense,

871
00:54:56,950 --> 00:54:59,570
so I'm just gonna give you a little personal space!

872
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:08,340
Rabbit, whatever you do, do not let go!

873
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:10,580
- I'm gonna let go! - You're gonna to what?

874
00:55:10,580 --> 00:55:12,850
One, two...

875
00:55:13,130 --> 00:55:15,160
Rabbit!

876
00:55:19,780 --> 00:55:22,420
Carrots, you saved my life.

877
00:55:22,620 --> 00:55:25,580
Well, that's what we do at the ZPD...

878
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,100
Well, this should be good.

879
00:55:46,450 --> 00:55:48,060
I thought this was just a missing mammal case,

880
00:55:48,060 --> 00:55:49,340
but it's way bigger.

881
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:51,970
Mr. Otterton did not just disappear.

882
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:54,830
I believe he and this jaguar, they...

883
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:56,220
They went savage, sir.

884
00:55:56,220 --> 00:55:58,970
Savage? This isn't the stone age, Hopps.

885
00:55:58,980 --> 00:56:00,930
Animals don't go savage.

886
00:56:00,930 --> 00:56:02,560
I thought so too.

887
00:56:02,730 --> 00:56:04,400
Till I saw this.

888
00:56:06,380 --> 00:56:07,370
What?

889
00:56:07,650 --> 00:56:09,160
He was right here!

890
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:11,050
The savage jaguar?

891
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:13,810
Sir, I know what I saw. He almost killed us!

892
00:56:13,810 --> 00:56:16,870
Or maybe any aggressive predator

893
00:56:16,870 --> 00:56:19,370
looks savage to rabbits?

894
00:56:19,710 --> 00:56:20,660
Let's go!

895
00:56:20,670 --> 00:56:21,610
Wait! Sir!

896
00:56:21,610 --> 00:56:23,400
I'm not the only one who saw him.

897
00:56:23,470 --> 00:56:24,440
Nick.

898
00:56:25,870 --> 00:56:27,840
You think I'm gonna believe a fox?

899
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:29,420
Well, he was a key witness, and I...

900
00:56:29,420 --> 00:56:33,770
Two days to find the otter, or you quit.

901
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:35,640
That was the deal.

902
00:56:36,230 --> 00:56:37,730
Badge.

903
00:56:43,470 --> 00:56:45,280
- But, sir, we had... - Badge!

904
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:51,730
Uh, no.

905
00:56:52,890 --> 00:56:54,470
What did you say, fox?

906
00:56:54,470 --> 00:56:57,900
Sorry, what I said was "No...".

907
00:56:58,220 --> 00:57:00,360
She will not be giving you that badge.

908
00:57:00,820 --> 00:57:05,040
Look, you gave her a clown vest, and a three-wheeled joke-mobile,

909
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:06,260
and two days to solve a case

910
00:57:06,270 --> 00:57:08,840
you guys haven't cracked in two weeks?

911
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,770
Yeah, it's no wonder she needed to get help from a fox.

912
00:57:11,770 --> 00:57:14,110
None of you guys were gonna help her, were you?

913
00:57:14,110 --> 00:57:15,500
Here's the thing, chief.

914
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:19,170
You gave her the 48 hours, so technically we still have...

915
00:57:19,350 --> 00:57:21,470
ten left to find our Mr. Otterton.

916
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:23,270
And that's exactly what we're gonna do.

917
00:57:23,270 --> 00:57:24,790
So if you'll excuse us,

918
00:57:24,790 --> 00:57:28,590
we have a very big lead to follow and a case to crack.

919
00:57:28,590 --> 00:57:29,870
Good day.

920
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,560
Officer Hopps.

921
00:57:59,780 --> 00:58:00,770
Thank you.

922
00:58:02,370 --> 00:58:04,700
Never let them see that they get to you.

923
00:58:06,030 --> 00:58:07,120
So...

924
00:58:07,470 --> 00:58:09,860
Things do get to you?

925
00:58:10,470 --> 00:58:11,760
I mean not, not anymore.

926
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:15,590
But I was small and emotionally unbalanced

927
00:58:15,590 --> 00:58:16,780
like you once.

928
00:58:16,780 --> 00:58:19,090
- Har har. - No, it's true.

929
00:58:20,190 --> 00:58:23,320
I think I was 8, or maybe 9...

930
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:25,390
And all I wanted to do

931
00:58:25,390 --> 00:58:28,690
was join the Junior Ranger Scouts.

932
00:58:28,890 --> 00:58:31,300
So my mom scaped together enough money

933
00:58:31,300 --> 00:58:33,660
to buy me a brand new uniform.

934
00:58:33,660 --> 00:58:36,720
Because, by god, I was gonna fit in.

936
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:41,030
Even if I was the only predator in the troop, the only fox.

937
00:58:41,030 --> 00:58:41,840
Hey, Nick.

938
00:58:41,850 --> 00:58:43,860
I was gonna be part of a pack.

939
00:58:43,860 --> 00:58:47,670
- Ready for initiation? - Yeah. Pretty much born ready.

940
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:49,520
I was so proud.

941
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:56,030
Okay. Now raise your right paw, and deliver the oath.

942
00:58:56,030 --> 00:58:59,310
I, Nicholas Wilde, promise to be brave,

943
00:58:59,310 --> 00:59:03,170
loyal, helpful and trustworthy.

944
00:59:03,370 --> 00:59:06,030
Even though you're a fox?

945
00:59:07,080 --> 00:59:08,140
What?

946
00:59:10,300 --> 00:59:12,610
No, no! What did I do wrong, you guys?

947
00:59:12,610 --> 00:59:16,800
No, please! What did I do wrong? What did I do?

948
00:59:18,060 --> 00:59:21,350
If you thought we would ever trust a fox without a muzzle?

949
00:59:21,350 --> 00:59:23,570
You're even dumber than you look.

950
00:59:25,890 --> 00:59:27,890
Is he gonna cry?

951
00:59:43,820 --> 00:59:45,760
I learned two things that day.

952
00:59:46,450 --> 00:59:51,300
One,I was never gonna let anyone see that they got to me.

953
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:54,450
And two?

954
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:56,890
If the world's only gonna

955
00:59:56,890 --> 01:00:00,500
see a fox as shifty and untrustworthy...

956
01:00:00,610 --> 01:00:03,280
There's no point in trying to be anything else.

957
01:00:03,850 --> 01:00:07,780
Nick, you are so much more than that.

958
01:00:11,490 --> 01:00:13,290
Boy, look at that traffic down there.

959
01:00:13,290 --> 01:00:15,630
How about we go up to Chuck in traffic central?

960
01:00:15,630 --> 01:00:17,920
Chuck, how are things looking on the jam cams?

961
01:00:18,100 --> 01:00:19,990
Nick, I'm glad you told me.

962
01:00:21,090 --> 01:00:22,790
The jam cams...

963
01:00:22,790 --> 01:00:25,720
- Seriously, it's okay. - No, no no!

964
01:00:25,720 --> 01:00:30,320
There are traffic cameras everywhere. All over the canopy!

965
01:00:30,320 --> 01:00:32,210
Whatever happened to that jaguar...

966
01:00:32,210 --> 01:00:33,560
The traffic cameras would have caught it!

967
01:00:33,560 --> 01:00:36,980
- Bingo! - Ho-ho! Pretty sneaky, slick!

968
01:00:36,980 --> 01:00:39,960
However, if you didn't have access to the system before,

969
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:43,760
I doubt chief Buffalo Butt is gonna let you into it now.

970
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:48,040
No. But I have a friend at City Hall who might.

971
01:00:49,320 --> 01:00:52,360
Sir, if we could just review these very important billings.

972
01:00:52,360 --> 01:00:54,600
Sir! Oh, I'm sorry. Sir.

973
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:56,450
Okay! I heard you, Bellwether,

974
01:00:56,450 --> 01:00:58,370
just take care of it!

975
01:00:58,510 --> 01:01:00,960
Please. And clear my afternoon, I'm going out.

976
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:01,570
Oh, no, no.

977
01:01:01,570 --> 01:01:05,260
But, sir, you do have a meeting with Herds and Gradings. Sir, that's just, oh...

978
01:01:07,120 --> 01:01:08,850
Oh, mutton chops.

979
01:01:10,490 --> 01:01:13,530
Assistant Mayor Bellwether, we need your help.

980
01:01:13,130 --> 01:01:16,400
{\an8}Office of the assistant mayor

981
01:01:14,790 --> 01:01:17,570
we just need to get into the traffic cam database.

982
01:01:25,900 --> 01:01:27,860
So fluffy!

983
01:01:28,080 --> 01:01:29,860
Sheep never let me get this close!

984
01:01:29,860 --> 01:01:31,540
You can't just touch a sheep's wool!

985
01:01:31,540 --> 01:01:33,440
- It's like cotton candy. - Stop it!

986
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:34,690
Where to?

987
01:01:35,340 --> 01:01:37,910
Rainforest Dsitrict. Vine and Tujunga.

988
01:01:38,050 --> 01:01:39,890
There. Traffic cams for the whole city.

990
01:01:40,570 --> 01:01:42,660
This is so exiting actually. I mean, well, you know.

991
01:01:42,660 --> 01:01:44,530
I never get to do anything this important.

992
01:01:44,530 --> 01:01:47,100
But you're the assistant mayor of Zootopia.

993
01:01:47,330 --> 01:01:49,470
I'm more of a glorified secretary.

994
01:01:49,570 --> 01:01:52,180
I think Mayor Lionheart just wanted the sheep vote.

995
01:01:52,180 --> 01:01:54,030
But he did give me that nice mug.

997
01:01:55,570 --> 01:01:57,620
Feels good to be appreciated.

998
01:01:57,620 --> 01:01:59,030
Smellwether!

999
01:01:59,310 --> 01:02:01,890
That's a fun little name he likes to use.

1000
01:02:01,890 --> 01:02:05,310
I called him Lionfart once, he did not care for that.

1001
01:02:05,310 --> 01:02:06,640
Let me tell you, it was not a good day for me.

1002
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:09,010
- Yes, sir. - I thought you were gonna cancel my afternoon.

1003
01:02:09,010 --> 01:02:12,570
Oh, dear. I better go. Let me know what you find.

1004
01:02:12,570 --> 01:02:15,060
It was really nice for me to be...

1005
01:02:15,060 --> 01:02:17,130
While we're young, Smellwether.

1006
01:02:19,030 --> 01:02:21,140
You think when she goes to sleep she counts herself?

1007
01:02:21,140 --> 01:02:23,270
Shush. Okay, traffic cams..

1009
01:02:23,110 --> 01:02:24,880
Tujunga.... Tujunga....

1010
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:26,100
We're in.

1011
01:02:31,940 --> 01:02:36,340
- Who are these guys? - Timberwolves.

1012
01:02:36,600 --> 01:02:38,520
Look at these dum-dums.

1013
01:02:42,370 --> 01:02:44,610
Bet you a nickel one of them's gonna howl.

1014
01:02:45,190 --> 01:02:46,080
And there it is.

1015
01:02:46,080 --> 01:02:49,540
I mean, what is it with wolves and the howling, it's...?

1016
01:02:49,540 --> 01:02:51,500
Howlings! Night Howlers!

1017
01:02:51,500 --> 01:02:53,040
That's what Manchas was afraid of,

1018
01:02:53,040 --> 01:02:55,570
wolves! The wolves are the Night Howlers!

1019
01:02:55,570 --> 01:02:56,520
If they took Manchas...

1020
01:02:56,520 --> 01:02:58,390
I bet they took Otterton too.

1021
01:02:58,550 --> 01:03:00,360
All we gotta do is find out where they went.

1024
01:03:08,100 --> 01:03:09,170
Wait, where'd they go?

1025
01:03:09,170 --> 01:03:09,610
You know,

1026
01:03:09,610 --> 01:03:13,250
if I wanted to avoid surveillance because I was doing something illegal,

1027
01:03:13,250 --> 01:03:16,460
which I never have, I would use the maintenance tunnel 6B.

1029
01:03:16,700 --> 01:03:19,600
Which would put them out... right there.

1030
01:03:20,330 --> 01:03:23,380
Well, look at you, junior detective.

1031
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:28,370
You know, I think you'd actually make a pretty good cop.

1032
01:03:28,590 --> 01:03:29,740
How dare you.

1033
01:03:30,320 --> 01:03:32,930
Acacia Alley. Ficus Underpass.

1034
01:03:32,930 --> 01:03:34,150
South canyon.

1035
01:03:34,340 --> 01:03:35,890
They're heading out of town.

1036
01:03:35,990 --> 01:03:37,630
Where does that road go?

1038
01:04:22,430 --> 01:04:24,410
Gary, quit it! You're gonna start a howl!

1039
01:04:24,410 --> 01:04:25,780
I didn't start it.

1040
01:04:33,160 --> 01:04:34,300
Come on.

1041
01:04:42,310 --> 01:04:44,910
You are a clever bunny.

1042
01:05:00,750 --> 01:05:04,230
It looks like this was a hospital.

1043
01:05:16,900 --> 01:05:18,790
You know, after you, you're the cop.

1044
01:05:27,240 --> 01:05:28,800
Okay, all clear.

1045
01:05:34,460 --> 01:05:36,870
All this equipment is brand new.

1046
01:05:38,020 --> 01:05:39,310
Carrots.

1047
01:05:42,080 --> 01:05:43,030
Claw marks.

1048
01:05:43,040 --> 01:05:46,510
Yeah, huge, huge claw marks. What kind of...

1049
01:06:05,260 --> 01:06:06,790
Mr. Manchas.

1050
01:06:17,170 --> 01:06:20,190
It's him! We found our otter.

1051
01:06:20,870 --> 01:06:24,280
Mr. Otterton, my name is Officer Judy Hopps.

1052
01:06:24,280 --> 01:06:26,080
Your wife sent me to find you.

1053
01:06:26,080 --> 01:06:27,900
We're gonna get you out of here now.

1054
01:06:28,910 --> 01:06:30,090
Or not.

1055
01:06:30,540 --> 01:06:33,050
Guess he's in no rush to get home to the missus.

1056
01:06:33,240 --> 01:06:35,400
11, 12, 13, 14.

1057
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:38,830
Not including Manchas, it's... it's fourteen.

1058
01:06:38,840 --> 01:06:41,660
Chief Bogo handed out 14 missing mammal files.

1059
01:06:41,860 --> 01:06:43,200
They're all here...

1060
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:46,520
All the missing mammals are right here.

1061
01:06:52,030 --> 01:06:53,200
Enough!

1062
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:55,910
I don't want excuses, doctor, I want answers.

1063
01:06:55,910 --> 01:06:59,210
Mayor Lionheart, please. We're doing everything we can.

1064
01:06:59,210 --> 01:07:00,280
Really?

1065
01:07:00,300 --> 01:07:02,310
Cause I got a dozen and a half animals here

1066
01:07:02,310 --> 01:07:03,990
who've gone off the rails crazy,

1067
01:07:03,990 --> 01:07:06,010
and you can't tell me why.

1068
01:07:06,010 --> 01:07:08,690
Now I'd call that awfully far from doing everything!

1069
01:07:08,690 --> 01:07:12,070
Sir, it may be time to consider their biology.

1070
01:07:12,080 --> 01:07:14,040
What? What do you mean "Biology"?

1071
01:07:14,040 --> 01:07:16,870
The only animals going savage are predators.

1072
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:20,260
We cannot keep it a secret. We need to come forward.

1073
01:07:20,260 --> 01:07:22,750
Hm, great idea. Tell the public.

1074
01:07:22,750 --> 01:07:23,850
And how do you think they're

1075
01:07:23,860 --> 01:07:28,020
gonna feel about their mayor who is a lion?!

1076
01:07:28,020 --> 01:07:30,630
- I'll be ruined! - Well, what does Chief Bogo say?

1077
01:07:30,630 --> 01:07:33,180
Chief Bogo doesn't know.

1078
01:07:33,180 --> 01:07:35,900
And we are going to keep it that way.

1080
01:07:36,780 --> 01:07:37,670
Oh, no!

1081
01:07:38,010 --> 01:07:40,750
- Someone's here. - Sir, you need to go. Now.

1082
01:07:40,750 --> 01:07:42,640
Security, sweep the area.

1083
01:07:50,740 --> 01:07:51,860
Great, we're dead.

1084
01:07:51,860 --> 01:07:55,260
We're dead. That's it. I'm dead. You're dead. Everybody's dead.

1085
01:07:55,260 --> 01:07:56,710
- Can you swim? - What?

1086
01:07:56,710 --> 01:07:59,360
Can I swim? Yes, I can swim. Why?

1087
01:08:19,070 --> 01:08:22,900
Carrots! Hopps! Judy!

1088
01:08:23,690 --> 01:08:25,470
We gotta tell Bogo!

1089
01:08:26,550 --> 01:08:30,350
Wow, you are one hot dancer, Chief Bogo.

1090
01:08:33,440 --> 01:08:34,950
- Chief Bogo! - Not now.

1091
01:08:34,950 --> 01:08:37,080
- Wait, is that Gazelle? - No!

1092
01:08:37,090 --> 01:08:40,470
I'm Gazelle, and you are one hot dancer.

1093
01:08:40,470 --> 01:08:44,880
You have the app too? Chief!

1094
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:46,130
Clawhauser! Can't you see

1095
01:08:46,130 --> 01:08:48,200
I'm working on the missing mammal cases?

1096
01:08:48,350 --> 01:08:49,810
Yes, of course. About that, sir.

1097
01:08:49,810 --> 01:08:53,110
Officer Hopps just called, she found all of them.

1098
01:08:53,240 --> 01:08:55,520
Wow, I'm impressed.

1099
01:08:58,290 --> 01:08:59,180
Mayor Lionheart,

1100
01:08:59,180 --> 01:09:00,800
you have the right to remain silent. Anything you...

1101
01:09:00,800 --> 01:09:03,840
You don't understand, I was trying to protect the city!

1102
01:09:03,840 --> 01:09:06,060
You were just trying to protect your job.

1103
01:09:06,070 --> 01:09:09,380
No, listen. We still don't know why this is happening.

1104
01:09:09,380 --> 01:09:11,340
It could destroy Zootopia.

1105
01:09:11,340 --> 01:09:13,080
You have the right to remain silent.

1106
01:09:13,080 --> 01:09:14,290
Anything you say can and

1107
01:09:14,290 --> 01:09:16,090
will be used against you in a court of law.

1109
01:09:21,090 --> 01:09:23,120
Ladies and gentlemammals,

1110
01:09:23,420 --> 01:09:27,240
14 mammals went missing and all 14 have been found...

1111
01:09:27,240 --> 01:09:31,020
by our newest recruit, who will speak to you in a moment.

1112
01:09:32,220 --> 01:09:35,470
- I'm so nervous. - Okay, press conference 101.

1113
01:09:35,470 --> 01:09:36,460
You wanna look smart,

1114
01:09:36,470 --> 01:09:38,160
answer their question with your own question

1115
01:09:38,160 --> 01:09:40,130
and then answer that question.

1116
01:09:40,330 --> 01:09:42,910
Like this, "Excuse me, Officer Hopps.

1117
01:09:42,910 --> 01:09:44,570
What can you tell us about the case?"

1118
01:09:44,680 --> 01:09:48,760
"Well, was this a tough case? Yes, yes it was. You see?"

1119
01:09:48,760 --> 01:09:50,330
You should be up there with me.

1120
01:09:50,590 --> 01:09:52,060
We did this together.

1121
01:09:52,060 --> 01:09:55,480
Well, am I a cop? No. No, I am not.

1122
01:09:56,250 --> 01:09:57,440
Funny you should say that.

1123
01:09:57,720 --> 01:10:00,220
Because, well, I've been thinking.

1124
01:10:00,320 --> 01:10:04,790
It would be nice to have a partner.

1125
01:10:09,690 --> 01:10:12,520
Here. In case you need something to write with.

1126
01:10:17,950 --> 01:10:20,280
Officer Hopps. It's time.

1127
01:10:24,340 --> 01:10:26,600
So now, I'll turn things over to

1128
01:10:26,600 --> 01:10:28,910
the officer who cracked the case.

1129
01:10:29,740 --> 01:10:31,690
Officer Judy Hopps.

1130
01:10:36,220 --> 01:10:37,040
Yes?

1131
01:10:37,050 --> 01:10:38,930
What can you tell us about the animals that went savage?

1132
01:10:38,930 --> 01:10:43,060
Well, the animals in question.

1133
01:10:46,690 --> 01:10:51,440
Are they all different species? Yes. Yes, they are.

1134
01:10:52,350 --> 01:10:54,500
Okay, so what is the connection?

1135
01:10:54,610 --> 01:10:55,780
All we know is that

1136
01:10:55,780 --> 01:10:58,640
they are all members of the predator family.

1137
01:10:58,640 --> 01:11:01,710
So predators are the only ones going savage?

1138
01:11:01,930 --> 01:11:03,850
That is accu.. Yes, that is accurate, yes.

1139
01:11:03,850 --> 01:11:07,620
- Why? Why is this happening? - We still don't know.

1140
01:11:08,240 --> 01:11:09,660
But, emm.

1141
01:11:09,830 --> 01:11:13,580
It may have something to do with biology.

1142
01:11:13,580 --> 01:11:15,170
What do you mean, biology?

1143
01:11:15,180 --> 01:11:17,530
A biological component.

1144
01:11:17,530 --> 01:11:20,860
You know, something in their DNA.

1145
01:11:21,580 --> 01:11:23,850
In their DNA, can you elaborate on that, please?

1146
01:11:23,850 --> 01:11:28,260
Yes. What I mean is thousands of years ago

1147
01:11:28,680 --> 01:11:32,940
Eh, predators survived through their...

1148
01:11:33,070 --> 01:11:36,200
agressive hunting instincts.

1149
01:11:36,250 --> 01:11:37,800
For whatever reason,

1150
01:11:37,830 --> 01:11:41,620
they seem to be reverting back to their primitive, savage ways.

1151
01:11:45,820 --> 01:11:48,240
Officer Hopps, could it happen again?

1152
01:11:48,240 --> 01:11:51,340
It is possible. So, we must be vigilant.

1153
01:11:51,340 --> 01:11:53,820
And we at the ZPD are prepered

1154
01:11:53,830 --> 01:11:54,920
and are here to protect you.

1155
01:11:54,920 --> 01:11:56,330
Will more mammals go savage?

1156
01:11:56,330 --> 01:11:57,620
What is being done to protect us?

1157
01:11:57,620 --> 01:11:59,930
Have you considered a mandatory quarantine on predators?

1158
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,120
Okay, thank you, Officer Hopps.

1159
01:12:02,270 --> 01:12:05,070
That's all the time that we have. No more questions.

1160
01:12:07,650 --> 01:12:10,180
- Was I okay? - Oh, you did fine.

1161
01:12:12,020 --> 01:12:13,500
That went so fast, I didn't get a chance to

1162
01:12:13,500 --> 01:12:15,510
mention you or say anything about how we...

1163
01:12:15,510 --> 01:12:18,110
Oh, I think you said plenty.

1164
01:12:18,390 --> 01:12:19,570
What do you mean?

1165
01:12:19,570 --> 01:12:22,420
"Clearly there's a biological component?"

1166
01:12:22,420 --> 01:12:24,780
"These predators may be reverting

1167
01:12:24,780 --> 01:12:27,450
back to their primitive, savage ways?"

1168
01:12:27,450 --> 01:12:29,320
Are you serious?

1169
01:12:29,360 --> 01:12:31,910
I just stated the facts of the case.

1170
01:12:31,910 --> 01:12:34,450
I mean, it's not like a bunny could go savage.

1171
01:12:34,450 --> 01:12:36,560
Right, but a fox could? Huh?

1172
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:38,790
Nick, stop it, you're not like them.

1173
01:12:38,790 --> 01:12:41,140
Oh, there's a 'them' now?

1174
01:12:41,210 --> 01:12:43,920
You know what I mean, you're not that kind of predator.

1175
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:45,490
The kind that needs to be muzzled?

1176
01:12:45,500 --> 01:12:46,950
The kind that makes you think

1177
01:12:46,950 --> 01:12:49,840
you need to carry around fox repellant?

1178
01:12:49,840 --> 01:12:50,630
Yeah, don't think I didn't

1179
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:52,810
notice that little item the first time we met.

1180
01:12:53,280 --> 01:12:56,530
Look. Let me ask you a question. Are you afraid of me?

1181
01:12:58,470 --> 01:13:00,100
Do you think I might go nuts?

1182
01:13:01,290 --> 01:13:03,140
You think I might go savage?

1183
01:13:03,350 --> 01:13:07,030
You think I might try to eat you?

1184
01:13:10,400 --> 01:13:12,080
I knew it, huh.

1185
01:13:13,540 --> 01:13:16,050
Just when I thought somebody actually believed in me, huh?

1186
01:13:16,510 --> 01:13:20,420
Probably best if you don't have a predator as a partner.

1188
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:28,330
No, Nick. Nick!

1189
01:13:28,330 --> 01:13:30,680
Officer Hopps, were you just threatened by that predator?

1190
01:13:30,690 --> 01:13:32,390
No, he's my friend.

1191
01:13:32,390 --> 01:13:34,450
We can't even trust our own friends?

1192
01:13:34,450 --> 01:13:36,090
That is not what I said. Please.

1193
01:13:36,240 --> 01:13:39,140
- Are we safe? - Have any other foxes gone savage?

1194
01:13:39,270 --> 01:13:41,950
More bad news in this city gripped by fear.

1196
01:13:41,950 --> 01:13:43,890
A caribou is in critical condition.

1197
01:13:43,890 --> 01:13:46,510
The victim of a mauling by a savage polar bear.

1198
01:13:46,510 --> 01:13:48,780
This, the 27th such attack,

1199
01:13:48,790 --> 01:13:51,110
comes just one week after ZPD Officer,

1200
01:13:51,110 --> 01:13:52,610
Judy Hopps connected the

1201
01:13:52,610 --> 01:13:56,140
violence to traditionally predatory animals.

1202
01:13:56,140 --> 01:13:57,470
Meanwhile, a peace rally

1204
01:13:57,470 --> 01:14:01,200
organized by popstar Gazelle was marred by protest.

1205
01:14:01,200 --> 01:14:05,090
- Go back to the forest, predator! - I am from the savannah.

1206
01:14:05,090 --> 01:14:07,090
Zootopia is a unique place.

1208
01:14:07,380 --> 01:14:10,900
It's a crazy, beautiful, diverse city.

1209
01:14:10,980 --> 01:14:13,110
Where we celebrate our differences.

1210
01:14:13,530 --> 01:14:15,680
This is not the Zootopia I know.

1211
01:14:16,540 --> 01:14:19,450
The Zootopia I know is better than this.

1212
01:14:19,780 --> 01:14:22,150
We don't just blindly assign blame.

1213
01:14:27,140 --> 01:14:29,630
We don't know why these attacks keep happening.

1214
01:14:30,080 --> 01:14:34,210
But it's irresponsible to label all predators as savages.

1215
01:14:40,760 --> 01:14:42,760
It's not my Emmitt.

1216
01:14:45,400 --> 01:14:47,960
We cannot let fear divide us.

1217
01:14:48,090 --> 01:14:52,460
Please give me back the Zootopia I love.

1218
01:14:55,790 --> 01:14:58,620
Come on, Hopps. The new mayor wants to see us.

1219
01:14:58,630 --> 01:15:01,140
The mayor? Why?

1220
01:15:01,540 --> 01:15:03,700
It would seem you've arrived.

1221
01:15:07,400 --> 01:15:10,710
Clawhauser? What are you doing?

1222
01:15:12,660 --> 01:15:15,840
They thought it would be better if a predator

1223
01:15:15,850 --> 01:15:19,490
such as myself wasn't the first face that you see

1224
01:15:19,560 --> 01:15:21,660
when you walk into the ZPD.

1225
01:15:21,730 --> 01:15:23,060
What?

1226
01:15:23,250 --> 01:15:27,040
They're gonna move me to records. It's downstairs.

1227
01:15:27,530 --> 01:15:28,950
It's by the boiler.

1228
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:32,540
Hopps!

1230
01:15:39,890 --> 01:15:41,440
I don't understand.

1231
01:15:41,460 --> 01:15:43,960
Our city is 90 % prey, Judy,

1232
01:15:43,960 --> 01:15:47,190
and right now they're just really scared.

1233
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:50,830
You're a hero to them. They trust you.

1234
01:15:50,850 --> 01:15:52,690
And so that's why Chief Bogo

1235
01:15:52,690 --> 01:15:57,460
and I want you to be the public face of the ZPD.

1236
01:16:01,950 --> 01:16:07,000
I'm... not... I'm not a hero.

1237
01:16:08,220 --> 01:16:11,150
I came here to make the world a better place. But...

1238
01:16:11,500 --> 01:16:13,370
...I think I broke it.

1239
01:16:13,370 --> 01:16:16,780
Don't give yourself so much credit, Hopps.

1240
01:16:17,180 --> 01:16:21,160
The world has always been broken, that's why we need good cops.

1241
01:16:22,750 --> 01:16:23,900
Like you.

1242
01:16:25,520 --> 01:16:28,980
With all due respect, sir,

1243
01:16:28,990 --> 01:16:33,900
a good cop is supposed to serve and protect.

1244
01:16:34,060 --> 01:16:38,550
Help the city. Not tear it apart.

1245
01:16:42,560 --> 01:16:46,150
- I don't deserve this badge. - Hopps.

1246
01:16:46,150 --> 01:16:49,260
Judy, you've worked so hard to get here.

1247
01:16:49,380 --> 01:16:51,730
It's what you've wanted since you were a kid.

1248
01:16:51,730 --> 01:16:53,390
You can't quit.

1249
01:16:53,960 --> 01:16:55,670
Thank you for the opportunity.

1251
01:17:15,370 --> 01:17:18,230
A dozen carrots. Have a nice day.

1252
01:17:18,230 --> 01:17:19,240
Come on.

1253
01:17:25,800 --> 01:17:28,160
Hey there, Jude. Jude the Dude.

1254
01:17:28,160 --> 01:17:30,860
Remember that one? How we doing?

1255
01:17:31,310 --> 01:17:34,650
- I'm fine. - You are not fine, your ears are droopy.

1256
01:17:35,960 --> 01:17:38,430
Why did I think I could make a difference?

1257
01:17:38,430 --> 01:17:40,380
Because you're a trier, that's why.

1258
01:17:40,380 --> 01:17:42,070
You've always been a trier.

1259
01:17:42,070 --> 01:17:43,800
Oh, I tried.

1260
01:17:43,840 --> 01:17:47,920
And it made life so much worse for so many innocent predators.

1261
01:17:48,400 --> 01:17:50,710
 not all of them, though. Speak of the devil. Right on time.

1263
01:17:53,320 --> 01:17:56,310
Is that Gideon Grey?

1264
01:17:56,480 --> 01:17:58,450
Yeah, it sure is. We work with him now.

1265
01:17:58,450 --> 01:18:00,850
He's our partner. And we never would have considered it,

1266
01:18:00,850 --> 01:18:02,970
- had you not opened our minds. - That's right.

1267
01:18:02,970 --> 01:18:04,210
I mean, kid's turned into one of

1268
01:18:04,210 --> 01:18:06,440
the top pastry chefs in the tri-burrows.

1269
01:18:08,240 --> 01:18:12,240
That's... That's really cool, you guys.

1270
01:18:13,310 --> 01:18:16,250
Gideon Grey. I'll be darned.

1271
01:18:16,250 --> 01:18:16,970
Hey, Judy.

1272
01:18:16,970 --> 01:18:18,650
I'd just like to say I'm sorry

1273
01:18:18,650 --> 01:18:20,850
for the way I behaved in my youth.

1274
01:18:20,850 --> 01:18:24,050
I had a lot of self-doubt, and it manifested itself

1275
01:18:24,050 --> 01:18:26,720
in the form of unchecked rage and agression.

1276
01:18:26,720 --> 01:18:28,930
I was a major jerk.

1277
01:18:29,810 --> 01:18:32,790
Well, I know a thing or two about being a jerk.

1278
01:18:34,530 --> 01:18:37,570
Anyhow, I brought you all these pies.

1279
01:18:38,300 --> 01:18:41,870
Hey, kids! Don't you run through that midnicampum holicithias.

1280
01:18:42,450 --> 01:18:44,760
Well, now. There's a four-dollar word, Mr. H.

1281
01:18:44,760 --> 01:18:47,500
My family always just call them Night Howlers.

1282
01:18:49,020 --> 01:18:50,570
I'm sorry. What did you say?

1283
01:18:50,820 --> 01:18:52,560
Kid's talking about those flowers, Judy.

1284
01:18:52,560 --> 01:18:54,360
I use them to keep the bugs off the produce,

1285
01:18:54,360 --> 01:18:55,950
but I don't like the little ones going near them

1286
01:18:55,950 --> 01:18:57,530
on acoount of what happened to your uncle Terry.

1287
01:18:57,530 --> 01:18:59,500
Yeah, Terry ate one whole when we were kids

1288
01:18:59,500 --> 01:19:00,880
and went completely nuts.

1289
01:19:00,880 --> 01:19:02,830
He bit the dickens out of your mother.

1290
01:19:03,440 --> 01:19:06,080
A bunny can go savage.

1291
01:19:06,080 --> 01:19:07,940
Savage? Well, that's a strong word.

1292
01:19:07,940 --> 01:19:09,420
But it did hurt like the devil.

1293
01:19:09,420 --> 01:19:10,320
 sure it did.

1294
01:19:10,330 --> 01:19:13,530
There's a sizable divot in your arm. I'd call that savage.

1295
01:19:13,640 --> 01:19:16,970
Night Howlers aren't wolves, they're flowers.

1296
01:19:16,970 --> 01:19:19,900
The flowers are making the predators go savage.

1297
01:19:20,130 --> 01:19:22,960
That's it! That's what I've been missing!

1298
01:19:23,320 --> 01:19:25,650
 keys! Keys! Keys! Keys! Hurry, come on!

1299
01:19:26,380 --> 01:19:28,540
Thank you! I love you, bye!

1300
01:19:33,620 --> 01:19:35,810
- You catch any of that, Bon? - Not one bit.

1301
01:19:35,810 --> 01:19:37,500
That makes me feel a little bit better,

1302
01:19:37,500 --> 01:19:39,840
I thought she was talking in tongues or something.

1303
01:19:56,990 --> 01:19:58,070
Who is it?

1304
01:19:58,540 --> 01:20:01,130
I need to find Nick. Please.

1305
01:20:02,970 --> 01:20:04,250
Nick?

1306
01:20:04,610 --> 01:20:05,890
Nick?

1307
01:20:09,140 --> 01:20:10,210
Nick.

1308
01:20:10,220 --> 01:20:14,380
Night Howlers aren't wolves, they're toxic flowers.

1309
01:20:14,510 --> 01:20:16,380
I think someone is targetting predators on purpose

1310
01:20:16,380 --> 01:20:18,250
and making them go savage.

1311
01:20:21,660 --> 01:20:23,180
Isn't that interesting?

1312
01:20:25,550 --> 01:20:28,860
Wait, please don't.. I know you'll never forgive me.

1313
01:20:28,860 --> 01:20:30,510
And I don't blame you.

1314
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:32,670
I wouldn't forgive me either.

1315
01:20:33,520 --> 01:20:38,850
It was ignorant, and irresponsible, and small-minded.

1316
01:20:40,070 --> 01:20:43,000
But predators shouldn't suffer because of my mistakes.

1317
01:20:43,470 --> 01:20:45,280
I have to fix this.

1318
01:20:46,020 --> 01:20:48,000
But I can't do it without you.

1319
01:20:49,180 --> 01:20:52,730
And... And after we're done...

1320
01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:56,280
you can hate me. And...

1321
01:20:56,500 --> 01:20:58,220
And that'll be fine.

1322
01:20:58,220 --> 01:21:03,050
Because I was a horrible friend and I hurt you.

1323
01:21:03,050 --> 01:21:09,160
And you can walk away knowing that you were right. All along.

1324
01:21:09,900 --> 01:21:13,280
I really am just a dumb bunny.

1325
01:21:17,670 --> 01:21:21,050
I really am just a dumb bunny.

1326
01:21:23,210 --> 01:21:26,440
I really am just a dumb bunny.

1327
01:21:26,490 --> 01:21:31,150
Don't worry, Carrots, I'll let you erase it. In 48 hours.

1328
01:21:33,290 --> 01:21:35,420
All right, get in here.

1329
01:21:37,960 --> 01:21:41,930
Okay. Oh, you bunnies. You're so emotional.

1330
01:21:41,940 --> 01:21:44,290
There we go, deep breath.

1331
01:21:44,560 --> 01:21:46,800
Are you-Are you just trying to steal the pen?

1332
01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:48,470
Is that what this is?

1333
01:21:49,240 --> 01:21:52,450
- You are standing on my tail, though. Off, off! - I'm sorry.

1335
01:21:57,190 --> 01:21:59,510
I thought you guys only grew carrots.

1336
01:22:00,990 --> 01:22:03,980
- What's your plan? - We are gonna follow the Night Howlers.

1337
01:22:03,980 --> 01:22:05,340
Okay, how?

1338
01:22:05,440 --> 01:22:08,970
- Know this guy? - I told you, I know everybody.

1339
01:22:09,830 --> 01:22:11,560
hello! Step right up.

1341
01:22:11,560 --> 01:22:13,510
Anything you need, I got it.

1342
01:22:13,510 --> 01:22:15,080
All your favorite movies.

1344
01:22:15,080 --> 01:22:17,590
I've got movies that haven't even been released yet.

1346
01:22:18,080 --> 01:22:19,840
 15 % off. 20!

1347
01:22:19,840 --> 01:22:22,010
Make me an offer. Come on!

1348
01:22:22,540 --> 01:22:25,340
look who it is, the Duke of Bootleg.

1349
01:22:25,340 --> 01:22:26,090
What's it to you, Wilde?

1350
01:22:26,090 --> 01:22:28,340
Shouldn't you be melting down a Pawpsicle or something?

1351
01:22:28,930 --> 01:22:30,880
 if it isn't flopsy the copsie.

1352
01:22:30,880 --> 01:22:34,170
We both know those weren't only onions I caught you stealing.

1353
01:22:34,180 --> 01:22:36,520
What were you gonna do with those Night Howlers, Weselton?

1354
01:22:36,520 --> 01:22:40,740
It's Weaselton, Duke Weaselton. And I ain't talking, rabbit.

1355
01:22:40,740 --> 01:22:43,360
And there ain't nothing you can do to make me.

1356
01:22:44,720 --> 01:22:46,020
Ice him.

1357
01:22:49,160 --> 01:22:51,610
You dirty rat, why are you helping her? She's a cop!

1358
01:22:51,610 --> 01:22:54,790
And the godmother to my future granddaughter.

1359
01:22:54,790 --> 01:22:57,110
I'm gonna name her Judy.

1360
01:22:58,290 --> 01:23:00,030
Ice this weasel.

1361
01:23:00,030 --> 01:23:02,230
All right, all right! Please! I'll talk. I'll talk.

1362
01:23:02,230 --> 01:23:04,040
I stole the Night Howlers so I could sell them.

1363
01:23:04,040 --> 01:23:07,050
They offered me what I couldn't refuse: Money.

1364
01:23:07,110 --> 01:23:09,200
And to whom did you sell them?

1365
01:23:09,200 --> 01:23:10,610
A ram named Doug.

1366
01:23:10,610 --> 01:23:12,370
We got a drop spot underground.

1367
01:23:12,390 --> 01:23:15,580
Just watch it. Doug is the opposite of friendly.

1369
01:23:15,950 --> 01:23:17,760
He's unfriendly.

1370
01:23:28,050 --> 01:23:28,960
Come on.

1371
01:23:42,430 --> 01:23:44,240
The weasel wasn't lying.

1372
01:23:44,240 --> 01:23:47,310
Yeah,it looks like old Doug's cornered the market on Night Howlers.

1373
01:24:31,430 --> 01:24:34,060
You got Doug here. What's the mark?

1374
01:24:34,900 --> 01:24:39,090
Cheetah in Sahara Square. Got it.

1375
01:24:39,550 --> 01:24:42,410
Serious? Yeah, I know they're fast, I can hit him.

1376
01:24:42,410 --> 01:24:44,500
Listen, I hit a tiny little otter

1377
01:24:44,500 --> 01:24:47,090
through the open window of a moving car.

1378
01:25:00,440 --> 01:25:02,060
Yeah, I'll buzz you when it's done.

1379
01:25:02,060 --> 01:25:03,830
 Or you'll see it on the news.

1380
01:25:03,830 --> 01:25:05,720
You know, whichever comes first.

1381
01:25:06,060 --> 01:25:09,360
Hey, Doug, open up! We've got your latte.

1382
01:25:09,360 --> 01:25:11,000
All right, Woolter and Jesse are back,

1383
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:12,930
so I'm leaving now. Out.

1384
01:25:12,930 --> 01:25:13,600
Hey. Wait, where you going?

1385
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:14,830
Where are you going? Get back here!

1386
01:25:14,840 --> 01:25:16,990
What are you doing? He's gonna see you!

1387
01:25:17,620 --> 01:25:19,220
What are you looking at? Hey!

1388
01:25:19,220 --> 01:25:20,900
Whatever you're thinking, stop thinking it.

1389
01:25:20,900 --> 01:25:24,060
Carrots. Carrots.

1390
01:25:24,290 --> 01:25:26,560
You better have the extra foam this time.

1391
01:25:29,550 --> 01:25:30,290
Hey! Open up!

1392
01:25:30,300 --> 01:25:32,930
What are you doing? You just trapped us in here!

1393
01:25:32,930 --> 01:25:35,050
We need to get this evidence to the ZPD.

1394
01:25:35,050 --> 01:25:38,250
- Okay, great. Here it is. Got it. - No, all of it.

1395
01:25:38,250 --> 01:25:39,640
Wait, what?

1396
01:25:42,510 --> 01:25:44,720
Oh, great, you're a conductor now, huh?

1397
01:25:44,720 --> 01:25:45,540
Hey. Listen.

1398
01:25:45,540 --> 01:25:48,800
It would take a miracle to get this rustbucket going.

1399
01:25:50,120 --> 01:25:52,020
Well. Hallelujah.

1400
01:25:52,020 --> 01:25:56,630
We kinda got a situation at the lab. It just got worse!

1401
01:25:57,960 --> 01:25:59,320
Mission accomplished.

1402
01:25:59,320 --> 01:26:01,930
Would it be premature for me to do a little victory toot-toot?

1403
01:26:01,930 --> 01:26:04,530
All right. One toot-toot.

1404
01:26:06,870 --> 01:26:09,770
Well, I can cross that off the bucket list.

1405
01:26:20,130 --> 01:26:22,320
I may have to rescind that victory toot-toot.

1406
01:26:24,420 --> 01:26:25,900
Maybe that's just hail.

1407
01:26:29,590 --> 01:26:30,660
Back off!

1408
01:26:35,930 --> 01:26:36,990
Incoming!

1409
01:26:40,520 --> 01:26:42,480
- Carrots! - Don't stop! Keep going.

1410
01:26:42,480 --> 01:26:43,870
No, stop. Please stop!

1411
01:26:43,870 --> 01:26:46,220
Do not stop this car!

1412
01:27:08,010 --> 01:27:09,680
Speed up, Nick. Speed up!

1413
01:27:09,690 --> 01:27:11,030
There's another train coming!

1414
01:27:11,030 --> 01:27:13,050
Trust me, speed up.

1415
01:27:16,870 --> 01:27:18,390
Stop the train!

1416
01:27:20,010 --> 01:27:22,090
Hey. Need some help?

1417
01:27:25,750 --> 01:27:29,030
Oh, no. Oh, no no no. Too fast! Too fast! Hold on!

1418
01:27:41,010 --> 01:27:42,500
I think this is our stop.

1419
01:27:51,500 --> 01:27:54,890
Okay, maybe... Maybe some of the evidence survived.

1420
01:28:03,850 --> 01:28:07,110
Everything is gone. We've lost it all.

1421
01:28:08,230 --> 01:28:11,160
Yeah. All, except for this.

1422
01:28:11,770 --> 01:28:13,700
Nick! Yes!

1423
01:28:13,880 --> 01:28:16,070
Come on! We gotta get to the ZPD.

1424
01:28:16,790 --> 01:28:18,740
Cut through the Natural History Museum.

1425
01:28:30,440 --> 01:28:34,180
- There it is. - Judy. Judy!

1426
01:28:35,030 --> 01:28:36,590
Mayor Bellwether.

1427
01:28:37,020 --> 01:28:38,300
We found out what's happening.

1428
01:28:38,300 --> 01:28:40,400
Someone's darting predators with a serum.

1429
01:28:40,400 --> 01:28:42,140
That's what's making them go savage.

1430
01:28:42,140 --> 01:28:45,520
I'm so proud of you, Judy. You did just a super job.

1431
01:28:45,520 --> 01:28:46,920
Thank you, ma'am.

1432
01:28:51,200 --> 01:28:53,360
How did you know where to find us?

1433
01:28:53,360 --> 01:28:55,020
I'll go ahead and I'll take that case now.

1434
01:28:55,020 --> 01:29:00,350
You know what? I think Nick and I will just take this to the ZPD.

1435
01:29:04,900 --> 01:29:05,970
- Run. - Run.

1436
01:29:07,110 --> 01:29:08,420
Get them!

1437
01:29:14,520 --> 01:29:15,590
Carrots!

1438
01:29:17,120 --> 01:29:18,930
Here, I got you. Get in here.

1439
01:29:21,370 --> 01:29:23,720
Okay. Now, just relax.

1440
01:29:24,840 --> 01:29:27,120
- Blueberry? - Pass.

1441
01:29:28,850 --> 01:29:31,040
Judy.

1442
01:29:31,290 --> 01:29:33,660
Take the case. Get it to Bogo.

1443
01:29:33,660 --> 01:29:35,450
I'm not gonna leave you behind, that's not happening.

1444
01:29:35,460 --> 01:29:38,280
- I can't walk. - Just.. We'll think of something.

1445
01:29:38,280 --> 01:29:40,710
We're on the same team, Judy.

1446
01:29:40,860 --> 01:29:45,000
Underestimated. Underappreciated.

1447
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:47,340
Aren't you sick of it?

1448
01:29:49,930 --> 01:29:53,790
Predators. They may be strong and loud.

1449
01:29:53,800 --> 01:29:57,190
But prey outnumber predators 10 to 1.

1450
01:30:01,400 --> 01:30:02,220
Think about it.

1451
01:30:02,220 --> 01:30:07,460
90% of the population united against a common enemy.

1452
01:30:07,460 --> 01:30:09,590
We'll be unstoppable.

1453
01:30:15,480 --> 01:30:16,550
Over there!

1454
01:30:33,490 --> 01:30:36,130
Well, you should have just stayed on the carrot farm, huh?

1455
01:30:36,410 --> 01:30:39,290
It really is too bad, I did like you.

1456
01:30:39,290 --> 01:30:41,770
What are you gonna do? Kill me?

1457
01:30:42,840 --> 01:30:44,650
No, of course not.

1458
01:30:45,090 --> 01:30:46,260
He is.

1459
01:30:46,660 --> 01:30:49,060
No! Oh, Nick?

1460
01:30:49,620 --> 01:30:54,300
Yes, police! There's a savage fox in the Natural History Museum!

1461
01:30:54,300 --> 01:30:57,340
Officer Hopps is down. Please hurry!

1462
01:30:57,810 --> 01:30:59,160
No, Nick. Don't do this. Fight it.

1463
01:30:59,160 --> 01:31:02,290
Oh, but he can't help it. Can he?

1464
01:31:02,390 --> 01:31:07,460
Since predators are just biologically predisposed to be savages.

1465
01:31:18,260 --> 01:31:20,940
Gosh! Think of the headline!

1466
01:31:21,190 --> 01:31:24,860
Hero Cop Killed by Savage Fox.

1467
01:31:25,970 --> 01:31:26,990
So that's it?

1468
01:31:26,990 --> 01:31:30,080
Prey fears predator, and you stay in power?

1469
01:31:30,080 --> 01:31:31,700
Yeah. Pretty much.

1470
01:31:31,700 --> 01:31:33,020
It won't work.

1471
01:31:33,020 --> 01:31:35,580
Fear always works.

1472
01:31:35,580 --> 01:31:38,960
And I'll dart every predator in Zootopia to keep it that way.

1473
01:31:42,060 --> 01:31:44,420
Oh, Nick. No.

1474
01:31:47,390 --> 01:31:48,850
Bye-bye, bunny.

1475
01:31:55,320 --> 01:31:59,450
Blood, blood, blood! And death.

1476
01:31:59,450 --> 01:32:00,770
All right, you know you're milking it.

1477
01:32:00,770 --> 01:32:02,680
Besides, I think we got it. I think we got it.

1478
01:32:02,680 --> 01:32:04,900
We got it up there, thank you, yakety-yak.

1479
01:32:04,900 --> 01:32:06,870
You laid it all out beautifully.

1480
01:32:06,870 --> 01:32:07,550
What?

1481
01:32:07,550 --> 01:32:09,560
Yeah. Oh, are... are you looking for the serum?

1482
01:32:09,790 --> 01:32:10,800
Well, it's right here.

1483
01:32:10,800 --> 01:32:12,290
What you've got in the weapon there,

1484
01:32:12,380 --> 01:32:15,070
those are blueberries, from my family's farm.

1485
01:32:15,960 --> 01:32:18,240
They are delicious. You should try some.

1486
01:32:18,740 --> 01:32:21,650
I framed Lionheart, I can frame you too.

1487
01:32:21,770 --> 01:32:24,260
It's my word against yours.

1488
01:32:24,780 --> 01:32:26,050
Actually...

1489
01:32:26,270 --> 01:32:29,630
And I'll dart every predator in Zootopia to keep it that way.

1490
01:32:29,630 --> 01:32:31,510
It's your word against yours.

1491
01:32:32,360 --> 01:32:35,310
It's called a hustle, Sweetheart. Boom!

1492
01:32:42,620 --> 01:32:45,260
Former mayor, Dawn Bellwether is behind bars today,

1494
01:32:45,260 --> 01:32:47,570
guilty of masterminding the savage attacks

1495
01:32:47,570 --> 01:32:49,450
that have plagued Zootopia of late.

1496
01:32:49,450 --> 01:32:51,630
Her predecessor, Leodore Lionheart,

1498
01:32:51,630 --> 01:32:53,460
denies any knowledge of her plot,

1499
01:32:53,460 --> 01:32:56,050
claiming he was just trying to protect the city.

1500
01:32:56,050 --> 01:32:58,490
Did I falsely imprison those animals?

1501
01:32:58,570 --> 01:33:00,080
Well, yes. Yes, I did.

1502
01:33:00,080 --> 01:33:00,960
It was a classic

1503
01:33:00,960 --> 01:33:03,940
doing the wrong thing for the right reason kind of a deal.

1504
01:33:03,940 --> 01:33:05,680
In related news, doctors say

1506
01:33:05,680 --> 01:33:08,340
the Night Howlers' antidote is proving effective

1507
01:33:08,340 --> 01:33:11,110
in rehabilitating the afflicted predators.

1508
01:33:16,230 --> 01:33:18,500
Oh, Emmitt!

1509
01:33:21,860 --> 01:33:23,080
Thank you.

1510
01:33:25,830 --> 01:33:27,260
When I was a kid,

1511
01:33:27,790 --> 01:33:31,490
I thought Zootopia was this perfect place.

1512
01:33:31,490 --> 01:33:33,460
Where everyone got along,

1513
01:33:33,760 --> 01:33:36,390
and anyone could be anything.

1514
01:33:37,070 --> 01:33:38,300
Turns out,

1515
01:33:38,590 --> 01:33:40,440
real life is a little bit more complicated

1516
01:33:40,440 --> 01:33:42,750
than a slogan on a bumper sticker.

1517
01:33:43,240 --> 01:33:45,480
Real life is messy.

1518
01:33:46,440 --> 01:33:48,830
We all have limitations.

1519
01:33:48,980 --> 01:33:50,650
We all make mistakes.

1520
01:33:50,650 --> 01:33:54,820
Which means, hey, glass half full, we all have a lot in common.

1521
01:33:55,140 --> 01:33:57,970
And the more we try to understand one another.

1522
01:33:58,130 --> 01:34:00,460
The more exceptional each of us will be.

1523
01:34:02,010 --> 01:34:03,640
But we have to try.

1524
01:34:04,940 --> 01:34:07,420
So no matter what type of animal you are.

1525
01:34:07,890 --> 01:34:12,900
From the biggest elephant, to our first fox.

1526
01:34:14,520 --> 01:34:16,100
I implore you.

1527
01:34:16,810 --> 01:34:21,170
Try... Try to make the world a better place.

1529
01:34:23,350 --> 01:34:29,010
Look inside yourself and recognize that change starts with you.

1530
01:34:30,580 --> 01:34:36,440
It starts with me. It starts with all of us.

1532
01:34:43,170 --> 01:34:46,700
All right, all right, enough. Shut it!

1533
01:34:47,620 --> 01:34:51,040
We have some new recruits with us this morning.

1534
01:34:51,160 --> 01:34:52,780
Including our first fox.

1535
01:34:53,680 --> 01:34:54,790
Who cares.

1536
01:34:55,170 --> 01:34:57,520
You should have your own line of inspirational greeting cards, sir.

1537
01:34:57,520 --> 01:34:59,180
Shut your mouth, Wilde.

1538
01:34:59,540 --> 01:35:00,690
Assignments.

1539
01:35:01,090 --> 01:35:05,830
Officers Grizzoli, Fragmeyer, Delgato. Tundratown SWAT.

1540
01:35:05,840 --> 01:35:09,220
Snarlov, Higgins, Wolfard. Undercover.

1541
01:35:10,280 --> 01:35:14,360
Hopps, Wilde. Parking duty.

1542
01:35:14,480 --> 01:35:15,620
Dismissed.

1543
01:35:16,500 --> 01:35:17,820
Just kidding!

1544
01:35:18,350 --> 01:35:21,950
We have reports of a street racer tearing up Savannah Central.

1545
01:35:22,130 --> 01:35:24,200
Find him. Shut him down.

1546
01:35:24,520 --> 01:35:28,310
So are all the rabbits bad drivers, or is it just you?

1547
01:35:29,970 --> 01:35:31,900
Oops. Sorry.

1548
01:35:33,260 --> 01:35:34,620
Sly bunny.

1549
01:35:34,620 --> 01:35:35,780
Dumb fox.

1550
01:35:35,940 --> 01:35:37,650
You know you love me.

1551
01:35:37,830 --> 01:35:39,140
Do I know that?

1552
01:35:39,740 --> 01:35:42,030
Yes. Yes, I do.

1554
01:35:56,190 --> 01:35:58,540
Sir, you were going 115 miles per hour,

1555
01:35:58,540 --> 01:36:00,580
I hope you have a good explanation.

1556
01:36:01,810 --> 01:36:05,410
Flash, Flash. Hundred Yard Dash!

1557
01:36:08,690 --> 01:36:10,860
Nick...

1558
01:36:13,240 --> 01:36:15,460
Good evening, Zootopia!

1559
01:36:15,530 --> 01:36:18,220
Come on, everybody. Put your paws up.

1560
01:36:18,070 --> 01:36:22,480
{\an8}I messed up tonight, I lost another fight *

1561
01:36:22,480 --> 01:36:26,330
{\an8}I still mess up but I'll just start again *

1562
01:36:26,360 --> 01:36:30,790
{\an8}I keep falling down, I keep on hitting the ground *

1563

{\an8}I always get up now to see what's next *

1564
01:36:35,170 --> 01:36:38,510
{\an8}I won't give up, no I won't give in *

1565
01:36:38,510 --> 01:36:43,010
{\an8}'Til I reach the end and then I'll start again *

1566
01:36:43,010 --> 01:36:47,110
{\an8}No I won't leave, I wanna try everything *

1567
01:36:47,110 --> 01:36:51,030
{\an8}I wanna try even though I could fail *

1568
01:36:51,810 --> 01:36:55,110
{\an8}I won't give up, no I won't give in *

1569

1570
